# Modal Component Usage Guide
**UI_SPECIALIST_1 - Task 1.1.10**
**Date:** August 3, 2025

## Introduction
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using the new unified Modal component system. It includes best practices, dos and don'ts, integration steps, troubleshooting, and a checklist for future implementations.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Appropriate Modal Variant
- **SimpleModal**: For basic alerts, confirmations, or simple actions.
- **ContentModal**: For complex layouts, flyouts, dashboards.
- **FormModal**: For data input, submission with validation.
- **ConfirmationModal**: For confirm/cancel actions.

### 2. Follow Consistent Styling
- Use pre-defined size options for modal dimensions (sm, md, lg, xl, full).
- Stick to context-wide z-index conventions, starting at 1000 and incrementing appropriately.

### 3. Optimize for Accessibility
- Always use accessible labels and descriptions.
- Ensure focus trapping and escape to close functionality is in place.

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Display error messages prominently at the top of the modal.
- Consider user flows where errors might occur and cover each path.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do
- Abstract modal content into components for form or complex content.
- Use semantic HTML within modals.
- Ensure all modals are dismissible.
- Implement proper state management, preferably using useModal or similar hooks.

### Don't
- Overload modals with too many actions.
- Use modal for primary navigation.
- Ignore mobile responsiveness â€” test all modals on mobile.
- Forget to test usability with screen readers or with keyboard navigation only.

## Integration Steps

1. **Identify** the need for modal and select the appropriate variant.
2. **Import** the desired modal component:
   
   `	sx
   import { Modal } from 'path/to/staging/ui-specialist-1/components/ui/Modal';
   `

3. **Implement** the modal with the relevant props:
   
   `	sx
   const myModal = useModal();
   
   return (
     <div>
       <Button onClick={myModal.open}>Open Modal</Button>
       <Modal
         variant="content"
         isOpen={myModal.isOpen}
         onClose={myModal.close}
         title="Example Modal"
       >
         <div>Your content here</div>
       </Modal>
     </div>
   );
   `

4. **Customize** modal size and behavior as needed through props.
5. **Ensure** accessibility standards are maintained, including proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
6. **Test** responsiveness, especially on mobile.
7. **Optimize** and test performance for large content or actions leading to modals.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Modal Doesn't Open/Close**
   - Ensure isOpen state is managed correctly and toggled with onClose.

2. **Keyboard Traps**
   - Verify focus management within modal.

3. **Performance Lag**
   - Optimize heavy content or reduce modal size for large datasets.

4. **Visual Glitches**
   - Check CSS for conflicts in positioning or resizing.

5. **Accessibility Warnings**
   - Run axe-core or similar tools to identify any accessibility barriers.

## Future Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Choose correct modal variant.
- [ ] Confirm responsive layout.
- [ ] Verify accessibility with screen readers.
- [ ] Test focus behavior and keyboard interactions.
- [ ] Test performance under realistically loaded scenarios.
- [ ] Review error handling states and pathways.

## Conclusion

The modal system aims to provide a seamless user experience with consistent accessibility and performance benchmarks. Following this guide ensures effective implementation and maintenance of modals within your application.
