# Data Source Integration Research Report

## 1. Task: 2.3.1 - Research Street Food Finder and similar sources

### 1.1. Initial Findings

My initial research identified several potential data sources for food truck information:

*   **Street Food Finder:** A popular web-based service with an interactive map for locating food trucks.
*   **Truckster:** Another mobile app and website that provides food truck locations and information.
*   **Open-Source APIs:** Several open-source APIs exist on platforms like GitHub that provide food truck data, although their coverage and accuracy may vary.
*   **Direct Scraping:** Many individual food trucks have their own websites, which could be scraped for information.

### 1.2. Street Food Finder Analysis

I performed a detailed analysis of the Street Food Finder website (streetfoodfinder.com) and have the following observations:

*   **Website Structure:** The site is a modern, map-based web application. The data is loaded dynamically, which makes it difficult to scrape with simple tools like `web_fetch`.
*   **Data Availability:** The site contains a wealth of information, including:
    *   Food truck names
    *   Cuisine types
    *   Operating hours
    *   Current and future locations
    *   Menus (in some cases)
    *   Customer reviews
*   **Scraping Feasibility:** Due to the dynamic nature of the site, a browser-based scraping tool like `browser_action` is required. A simple list of vendors is not readily available, so the data would need to be extracted from the map interface. This is a more complex scraping task, but it is feasible.
*   **Legal Considerations:** The Street Food Finder Terms of Service explicitly prohibit scraping, extracting, or screen recording any data from the site. **Therefore, we cannot use Street Food Finder as a data source.**

### 1.3. Next Steps

My next steps will be to:

1.  Research the other identified data sources in more detail.
2.  Create a data source evaluation matrix to compare the different options.
3.  Investigate the terms of service for the other potential data sources.
