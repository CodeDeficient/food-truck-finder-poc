# Archive

This directory contains archived documentation and deprecated content from the previous documentation structure.

⚠️ **Note on Broken Links**: Many internal links in archived documents point to files that were reorganized or moved during the documentation restructuring. These broken links are preserved as-is to maintain historical accuracy.

**Note:** This directory is automatically ignored via `.gitignore` to prevent archived content from cluttering the main documentation structure.

*This is a placeholder file to ensure Git tracks this directory. Content will be added as documents are archived.*
