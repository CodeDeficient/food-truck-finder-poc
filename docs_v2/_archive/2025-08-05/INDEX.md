## Archive Criteria

Files were archived because they were:
1. **Redundant** - Content exists in better form elsewhere
2. **Outdated** - Information no longer current or relevant
3. **Non-primary** - Secondary documentation superseded by new structure
4. **Duplicate** - Multiple versions exist with newer versions being primary

## Current Documentation Location

All current and active documentation is now located in:
- `docs_v2/` - New organized documentation structure

## Restoration

If any of these files need to be restored, they can be moved back to their original locations. However, consider whether the content should instead be integrated into the new docs_v2 structure.
