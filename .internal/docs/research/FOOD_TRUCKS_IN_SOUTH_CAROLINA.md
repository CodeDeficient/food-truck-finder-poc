# **Quantifying South Carolina's Mobile Culinary Landscape: A Comprehensive Data Exploration**

### **Executive Summary**

The most recent and direct figure suggests there are approximately 2,894 registered food trucks in South Carolina, as reported by the Palmetto Promise Institute, citing information provided by the South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA). This number reflects a growing industry, with specific examples like Charleston showing significant increases from 278 in 2022 to 424 currently.  
However, obtaining a precise, real-time count of food trucks in South Carolina is inherently challenging. This complexity stems from the highly decentralized nature of regulatory oversight, where requirements vary significantly across state, county, and municipal levels. Furthermore, definitional nuances of what constitutes a "food truck," the dynamic entry and exit of businesses, and the non-public aggregation of key state-level data contribute to the difficulty.  
A comprehensive count necessitates a multi-pronged strategy. This involves direct engagement with the primary state regulatory body (SCDA) to access their internal "registered" figures , systematic aggregation of permitting data from numerous local government offices , and contextual understanding derived from federal economic classifications and broader industry trends.  
Even with a robust methodology, the resulting figure will be an estimate. It will be subject to inherent data lag, potential discrepancies between "registered" and "actively operating" units, and the ongoing administrative burden of reconciling data from disparate sources with inconsistent reporting standards.

### **1\. Introduction: The Challenge of Quantifying South Carolina's Food Truck Landscape**

#### **1.1. Contextualizing the Growing Food Truck Industry**

The food truck sector has experienced significant national growth, with the number of establishments nearly doubling from 3,281 in 2013 to 5,970 in 2018, employing over 16,000 workers nationwide. This expansion is largely fueled by evolving consumer demand for convenient, affordable, and unique dining experiences, coupled with relatively low startup costs and the inherent mobility of the business model.  
The South Atlantic region, which encompasses South Carolina, is identified as a dominant and growing market for food trucks, benefiting from favorable weather conditions, robust tourism, and areas with high footfall. This regional market dynamic suggests that South Carolina's food truck growth is part of a larger, robust regional economic trend. This indicates that the pursuit of an accurate food truck count in South Carolina is not merely an academic exercise but addresses a significant and expanding economic segment. The regulatory frameworks within the state are likely adapting to this growth, which directly influences the availability and nature of the data. This makes the accurate quantification of this sector increasingly relevant for economic analysis, urban planning, and policy development.

#### **1.2. Objective of the Report**

The objective of this report is to systematically identify, evaluate, and analyze all possible data sources and methods for accurately determining the total number of food trucks operating in South Carolina. The aim is to provide a detailed framework for approaching this complex data challenge, explicitly acknowledging inherent limitations, and offering actionable recommendations for obtaining the most comprehensive and reliable estimate.

#### **1.3. Importance of Understanding Data Limitations**

It is crucial to establish upfront that a single, perfectly precise, and real-time count of food trucks is unlikely to be achievable. This is due to the dynamic nature of the industry, characterized by constant entries and exits, and the fragmented, often localized, regulatory landscape. Therefore, this report will focus on identifying the most reliable pathways to a robust estimate, emphasizing the critical distinctions between "registered," "permitted," and "actively operating" units, and the inherent nuances of data provenance.

### **2\. Primary State-Level Data: The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA)**

#### **2.1. The 2,894 Figure and its Provenance**

The most concrete statewide figure available is "2,894 registered food trucks in South Carolina," as reported by the Palmetto Promise Institute, explicitly attributing this information to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA). This figure serves as the primary baseline and most authoritative state-level estimate for the total number of food trucks. Further supporting the industry's growth, the number of food trucks in Charleston specifically increased from 278 in 2022 to 424 currently. This local example corroborates the overall expansion indicated by the statewide figure and highlights the dynamic nature of the market.  
The figure of 2,894 food trucks, while provided by the SCDA, specifically denotes "registered" entities. This distinction is critical because registration with a state agency does not automatically confirm that a food truck is actively operating at any given moment. Businesses may complete the registration process in preparation for launch, or they might cease operations without formally de-registering their permits. This inherent administrative lag means that "registered" numbers are likely to provide a count of formally recognized units, which could potentially overestimate the actual number of currently active mobile food units on the road. Furthermore, federal Census data, while offering national context, dates back to 2018 , underscoring the challenge of obtaining real-time figures in a rapidly evolving industry.

#### **2.2. SCDA's Role in Inspection and Permitting**

The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) is the primary state agency responsible for overseeing food safety and issuing permits for retail food establishments, a category that explicitly includes food trucks, across the entire state. A significant regulatory change occurred on July 1, 2024, when the responsibility for inspecting and permitting retail food establishments, including food trucks, officially transitioned from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to the SCDA. This recent shift is crucial for understanding current data provenance. The SCDA inspects approximately 24,000 retail food establishments statewide and issues permits to new facilities prior to their opening , confirming their comprehensive oversight and central role in the permitting process for mobile food units.  
The transfer of authority from DHEC to SCDA for food safety inspections and permitting is more than a mere administrative reshuffle. It represents a significant centralization of authority for all retail food establishments, including food trucks, under a single state agency, the SCDA. This consolidation, while not yet resulting in a publicly available aggregate list of food trucks , creates the potential for a more unified, comprehensive, and potentially more accessible state-level dataset in the future. The consolidation of regulatory authority, if properly leveraged, could significantly streamline data collection and aggregation, making a more accurate and easily obtainable statewide count feasible if the SCDA chooses to publicly disseminate this specific data for mobile food units. This implies a future opportunity for improved data transparency.

#### **2.3. Data Access and Limitations**

Despite the SCDA's central role in permitting, there is currently no explicit public list or aggregate data of permitted food trucks readily available online. To access aggregate data or a comprehensive list from the SCDA, direct communication with their Retail Food Safety Department (via email at retailfood@scda.sc.gov or scraig@scda.sc.gov, or by phone at 803-896-0640) is necessary. This highlights a "dark data" challenge. The SCDA is confirmed as the primary state permitting authority and is the source of the 2,894 "registered" figure. However, the current lack of public aggregation means the information exists within the agency's records but is not publicly accessible in an aggregated format. This means any attempt to derive a comprehensive statewide count from official sources will require proactive, direct communication and potentially formal data-sharing requests with the SCDA, rather than simple public database queries or web scraping. This represents a considerable hurdle for independent researchers seeking this specific data.  
The online Food Grades app provides access to individual establishment inspection reports for the last three years via a map search. While food trucks are included, this method is manual, labor-intensive, and not designed for compiling a statewide count specifically of food trucks.  
**Table 1: State-Level Regulatory Bodies and Their Data Utility**

| Regulatory Body | Primary Role | Data Type/Availability | Utility for Food Truck Count | Key Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) | Primary food safety permitting and inspection for retail food establishments, including food trucks. | Holds the "registered" count (2,894 reported). | Most authoritative state-level count. | Data is not publicly aggregated; requires direct inquiry. |
| South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) | Formerly handled food safety inspections for retail food establishments prior to July 1, 2024\. | Historical inspection data is accessible via the Food Grades app. | Useful for historical context. | No longer the primary permitting authority for new or ongoing food truck operations. |
| South Carolina Department of Revenue (SCDOR) | Responsible for business licenses, retail sales licenses, and hospitality taxes. | Food trucks are required to obtain a retail license. Could potentially provide aggregate business license data for relevant NAICS codes. | Potential for aggregate business license data. | Data is likely not publicly available in a granular format suitable for direct counting; not specific to "food trucks" per se. |

### **3\. Local Government Permitting and Licensing: A Decentralized Approach**

#### **3.1. Municipal Regulatory Variation**

Operating a food truck in South Carolina necessitates navigating a complex and often inconsistent array of permits and licenses, which "can vary significantly depending on the city, county, and state". This highly decentralized regulatory environment poses a major challenge to achieving a single, comprehensive statewide count. Local regulations typically encompass requirements for municipal business licenses, specific mobile food facility permits, local public health permits, and adherence to varying zoning laws and parking restrictions. The need for "thoroughly researching local regulations" is emphasized due to these intra-state differences.  
Multiple sources consistently highlight that food truck regulations are not uniform across South Carolina's various municipalities and counties. This creates what can be described as a "patchwork quilt" of local ordinances, where each jurisdiction may have its own specific permitting requirements, definitions, and data collection and dissemination practices. The implication for obtaining a comprehensive count is profound: there is no single, standardized local database to query. Instead, researchers must engage with potentially hundreds of individual municipal and county governments, each with potentially different data formats (e.g., static PDFs, searchable online lists, or requiring direct inquiry) and varying levels of data accessibility. This significantly increases the complexity, time, and resource intensity required to achieve a truly comprehensive bottom-up count.

#### **3.2. Case Studies of Local Data Availability**

Specific examples illustrate the varied landscape of local data. The city of Greenville, for instance, provides an "Active Food Truck Listings (PDF)" directly on its official government website , offering a valuable direct source for local data. Similarly, Fort Mill maintains an "Approved Mobile Food Vendor List" and outlines a clear approval process that involves inspections by the Fire Marshal and obtaining a Town Business License. This also serves as another example of a direct, accessible local data source. In Charleston, the Fire Marshal Division oversees the Mobile Food Vendor program and "maintains an approved list of vendors" , with regulations also specifying requirements for operating on private property and in designated public vending spaces.  
Further illustrating the administrative detail that generates local data, cities like Easley and Goose Creek provide granular insights into their ordinances. Easley's regulations state that "only one decal may be issued per business, owner, or vendor, and no one person may have more than one truck operation inside the city at any given time," and that "the permit and decal are issued to a specific vendor for a specific vehicle". This implies a per-truck count at the local level. Goose Creek's requirements illustrate a multi-layered permitting stack, including an SC DHEC permit (now SCDA), an SC Retail Sales License, and a Berkeley County Peddlers/Solicitor Permit.  
While the state-level SCDA provides an aggregate "registered" number , these specific local examples demonstrate that permits are often issued per vehicle or per vendor for a specific vehicle. This granular, per-unit permitting at the local level is crucial because if one were to successfully aggregate all such local lists, the resulting count would likely be closer to the actual number of operating physical units (trucks) rather than just businesses. The primary challenge, however, lies in the sheer volume of jurisdictions and the significant inconsistency in how they publish or share this data (e.g., static PDFs, online lists, or requiring direct inquiry), making a bottom-up aggregation extremely resource-intensive.

#### **3.3. Challenges of Aggregation**

Combining data from numerous local sources presents several significant challenges:

* **Inconsistent Definitions:** A significant challenge arises from the varied interpretations of what constitutes a "food truck" across different regulatory bodies and jurisdictions. This can range from traditional large mobile kitchens to caterers, and even privately-owned automobiles if food is prepared in a commercial kitchen. Such inconsistency complicates data aggregation and comparison, as different sources may be counting slightly different categories of mobile food vendors.  
* **Varying Reporting Frequencies:** Local lists and databases may not be updated consistently or frequently, leading to outdated information.  
* **Potential for Double-Counting:** Food trucks frequently operate in multiple jurisdictions, and thus may hold permits in each. This creates a high potential for overcounting if simple summation is used without a robust deduplication process. While Easley's "one decal per business" rule helps locally, it doesn't prevent a truck from being counted in multiple cities.  
* **Sheer Volume of Jurisdictions:** South Carolina comprises 46 counties and numerous municipalities, each potentially requiring individual contact, data extraction, and reconciliation, making a comprehensive manual aggregation an enormous undertaking.

The challenge of obtaining a comprehensive count extends far beyond merely identifying data sources; it critically involves the complex process of reconciling the collected data. With varying definitions, differing update schedules, and the inherent possibility of a single food truck holding multiple local permits across different cities , simply adding up numbers from various local sources will inevitably lead to an inaccurate, likely inflated, count. This means a robust methodology for a comprehensive food truck count must incorporate sophisticated data deduplication, standardization, and matching techniques, potentially requiring the identification of unique identifiers for each truck or business across jurisdictions—identifiers that are unlikely to be uniformly available. This elevates the task from straightforward data collection to a complex data engineering and analytical challenge.  
**Table 2: Examples of Local Government Data Sources and Their Utility**

| City/County | Data Available/Access Method | Specificity (Truck/Business) | Notes on Access/Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Greenville, SC | "Active Food Truck Listings (PDF)" | Per-truck/vendor | Direct download of static PDF; requires manual extraction and periodic checking for updates. |
| Fort Mill, SC | "Approved Mobile Food Vendor List" | Per-truck/vendor | Online list; specific to Fort Mill, requires aggregation with other local data. |
| Charleston, SC | Fire Marshal maintains an "approved list of vendors" | Per-truck/vendor | Requires direct inquiry to Fire Marshal's office; list not publicly available online. |
| Easley, SC | Local ordinances detail "one decal per vehicle" | Per-vehicle | Data likely internal to city records; illustrates per-vehicle permitting, requires direct inquiry. |
| Goose Creek, SC | Ordinances detail multi-level permitting requirements (SCDA, SC Retail Sales, County Peddler's) | Per-business/vehicle | Data likely internal to city records; illustrates complexity of required permits, requires direct inquiry. |

### **4\. Federal Data Sources: U.S. Census Bureau**

#### **4.1. Analysis of NAICS 72233 (Mobile Food Services)**

The U.S. Census Bureau classifies and tracks "Mobile Food Services" under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 72233\. Nationally, this category reported 5,970 establishments in 2018, nearly double the 3,281 establishments recorded in 2013\. This data provides valuable insight into the overall growth and economic footprint of the mobile food service industry at a macro level.  
The Census data explicitly states that it counts "establishments" and clarifies that "these data reflect the central location from which the caterer route is serviced and not where each food truck (or cart) owned by the business serves its customers." This is a critical definitional distinction. A single business entity (establishment) can own and operate multiple physical food trucks. Therefore, the NAICS 72233 count will inherently be lower than the actual number of individual physical food trucks. While Census data offers valuable macroeconomic context, trend analysis (e.g., growth, employment, payroll, business structure), and an understanding of the industry's fragmentation , it is fundamentally unsuitable for directly answering the query about the "total number of food trucks" (i.e., physical units) in South Carolina. It measures businesses, not vehicles.

#### **4.2. Limitations for South Carolina Count**

The provided Census data is national in scope and does not offer specific, granular breakdowns for South Carolina. While it notes that food trucks are "widely dispersed" and that many top counties are in Southern states, it does not provide a direct state-level count for South Carolina. Even at the county level, the Census data has acknowledged gaps, with 14% of national food trucks (866 units) located in counties where data was not published. This suggests that even if more granular data were available for South Carolina, it might be incomplete. The most recent data provided from the Census Bureau is from 2018 , making it significantly outdated for a current count, especially considering the industry's rapid growth observed in recent years.  
The U.S. Census Bureau data, despite its official nature, presents two significant limitations for the user's query: its temporal relevance and its granularity. The data is from 2018 , rendering it outdated for an industry characterized by rapid growth and dynamism. Furthermore, it provides national "establishment" counts, not specific "food truck" counts for South Carolina. Even if state-level establishment data were available, it would not directly count individual vehicles. This means that while Census data is excellent for understanding broad macro-trends and the economic structure of the mobile food service industry, it cannot serve as a primary source for a current, accurate count of physical food trucks in South Carolina. Its utility is primarily for contextualization rather than direct enumeration.

#### **4.3. Distinction from NAICS 7223 (Special Food Services)**

It is important to note the distinction between "Mobile Food Services" (NAICS 72233\) and the broader "Special Food Services" (NAICS 7223\) also mentioned in the provided information. The latter includes caterers and other special event food providers, which may or may not primarily operate through mobile food trucks. Focusing specifically on 72233 is crucial to avoid miscounting businesses that do not primarily function as food trucks.

### **5\. Industry Associations and Private Aggregators: Supplementary Information**

#### **5.1. Absence of a Comprehensive South Carolina Food Truck Association**

Extensive exploration indicates a notable absence of a single, comprehensive, and official "South Carolina Food Truck Association" that could provide an aggregated membership count or industry statistics. Existing associations mentioned are either regional or national , none of which provide specific, aggregated data for South Carolina.  
In many industries, professional or trade associations serve as valuable sources of aggregate data, often collecting membership numbers, conducting industry surveys, or acting as a central point of contact for their members. The explicit absence of a comprehensive, state-specific South Carolina Food Truck Association creates a significant data gap. This means there isn't a readily available, self-reported, and industry-driven aggregate count of food trucks in the state. This forces researchers to rely almost entirely on government-issued permits and licenses, which are often not designed for public aggregation or easy access. This also indirectly suggests a potential lack of unified advocacy or coordinated data collection efforts within the industry itself at the state level, which could impact future data availability and policy discussions.

#### **5.2. Role of Private Catering/Booking Platforms**

Private platforms, such as "Best Food Trucks" , serve as intermediaries connecting customers with food trucks for events and catering. While they list individual food trucks operating in South Carolina (e.g., "Smokin' Gringo's," "Kona Ice of S Lexington Co."), they do not provide an aggregate number of trucks on their platform for the state. These platforms are primarily business-driven directories and booking services, not official registries or comprehensive databases. Their lists are typically incomplete, only including trucks that choose to register with their service, and therefore cannot be used to generate an official or exhaustive total count of all food trucks in South Carolina.

### **6\. Overarching Challenges in Data Collection and Reconciliation**

#### **6.1. Definitional Ambiguity**

A significant challenge arises from the varied interpretations of what constitutes a "food truck" across different regulatory bodies and jurisdictions. This can range from traditional large mobile kitchens to caterers, and even privately-owned automobiles if food is prepared in a commercial kitchen. Such inconsistency complicates data aggregation and comparison, as different sources may be counting slightly different categories of mobile food vendors.

#### **6.2. Distinction Between Permitted Businesses and Actively Operating Trucks**

A "registered" or "permitted" business does not automatically equate to an "actively operating" physical food truck. Businesses may obtain permits as a preparatory step but then delay launching, or they may cease operations without formally de-registering their permits, leading to an inflated "registered" count compared to the actual active fleet.

#### **6.3. Dynamic Nature of the Industry**

The food truck industry is characterized by relatively low startup costs and high mobility , which facilitates frequent entry and exit of businesses. This inherent dynamism means that any static count, once compiled, rapidly becomes outdated, making it difficult to maintain a real-time accurate figure.  
The confluence of low startup costs, high mobility, and frequent business entry and exit creates a "moving target" scenario for any data collection effort aimed at counting food trucks. This dynamic nature means that any count, once meticulously compiled, is inherently a snapshot in time and rapidly prone to obsolescence. This indicates that for ongoing, accurate tracking, a one-time data collection project is insufficient. Instead, it would necessitate a more sophisticated, potentially automated, system for continuous monitoring, or at minimum, a commitment to frequent, periodic data refreshes from all relevant state and local sources. This points to the need for a sustained data strategy rather than a singular project.

#### **6.4. Data Lag in Official Publications**

Even when data is available from official sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau , it often lags significantly behind real-time operations. This temporal discrepancy reduces the accuracy and utility of such data for a current count.

#### **6.5. Complexity of Reconciling Disparate Sources**

Combining data from multiple state-level agencies (SCDA, SCDOR), county-level entities, and numerous individual municipal sources (e.g., Greenville, Fort Mill, Charleston, Easley, Goose Creek) presents considerable challenges. These include the need for sophisticated deduplication processes, data standardization, and careful reconciliation to ensure consistent definitions and avoid overcounting.

### **7\. Recommendations for a Comprehensive and Ongoing Count**

#### **7.1. Multi-Pronged Data Collection Strategy**

To obtain the most comprehensive and reliable estimate of food trucks in South Carolina, a multi-pronged data collection strategy is essential:

* **Direct Inquiry to SCDA:** The most direct and authoritative starting point is to initiate formal communication with the South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) Retail Food Safety Department. The primary objective should be to specifically request the aggregate number of currently active mobile food vendor permits. This direct engagement is essential for validating and potentially obtaining more granular data related to the 2,894 "registered" figure cited.  
* **Systematic Local Data Aggregation:** Implement a systematic and comprehensive effort to contact and collect data from the business licensing and permitting offices in all major South Carolina cities and counties (e.g., Greenville, Fort Mill, Charleston, Easley, Goose Creek). Specifically request lists of currently active mobile food vendor permits, emphasizing the need for per-vehicle counts where local regulations allow. Be prepared to process data in diverse formats, including static PDFs, online searchable databases requiring manual extraction, or direct data exports if available.  
* **Cross-Referencing and Deduplication:** Develop and implement a robust methodology for cross-referencing and reconciling data collected from both state and numerous local sources. This is critical to identify and remove duplicate entries (e.g., a single food truck permitted in multiple cities). This process will require careful analysis of business names, physical addresses, and permit numbers to ensure an accurate, unduplicated count.  
* **Contextual Analysis with Federal Data:** Utilize U.S. Census Bureau data (NAICS 72233\) to gain a broader understanding of national industry trends, employment figures, and the overall economic impact of mobile food services. However, explicitly acknowledge its limitations as a source for a precise, current unit count of physical food trucks in South Carolina.

#### **7.2. Advocating for Centralized State-Level Registry**

Given the significant fragmentation of local regulations and data availability , a long-term recommendation is to advocate for the establishment of a centralized, publicly accessible state-level registry or database specifically for mobile food vendors. The current landscape for counting food trucks in South Carolina is characterized by significant fragmentation, necessitating extensive manual effort to compile data from disparate sources. While the SCDA holds a key aggregate number, it is not publicly disseminated. This scenario highlights a clear policy opportunity. The implementation of a centralized state-level registry for mobile food vendors would not only streamline the permitting process for business owners but also vastly improve data accessibility and accuracy for researchers, economic developers, and policymakers. This indicates that the current difficulty in obtaining a comprehensive count is not merely a research challenge but also a reflection of an unoptimized regulatory and data management framework at the state level. Such a system would dramatically improve transparency, streamline data accessibility for researchers and policymakers, and enhance the accuracy of future counts.

#### **7.3. Consideration of Periodic Surveys/Direct Outreach**

While beyond the scope of readily available public data, for a truly comprehensive and real-time understanding of the food truck landscape, consider supplementing official permit data with periodic surveys or direct outreach to food truck operators. This could be facilitated through existing (though not comprehensive) industry groups or by collaborating with event organizers. Such methods could help capture information on non-permitted operations or those operating in regulatory grey areas, providing a more complete picture.

### **8\. Conclusion: Navigating the Data Landscape for South Carolina Food Trucks**

#### **8.1. Synthesizing the Findings**

In conclusion, while obtaining a single, perfectly precise, and real-time count of every food truck in South Carolina remains challenging due to the industry's dynamic nature and fragmented regulatory environment, a robust and well-informed estimate can certainly be derived. The figure of 2,894 registered food trucks, as reported by the Palmetto Promise Institute citing the SCDA , provides the most authoritative state-level baseline. However, this figure must be critically contextualized and supplemented by granular data meticulously collected and reconciled from numerous local permitting offices across the state to capture the full scope of actively operating units and account for local variations.

#### **8.2. Emphasizing Ongoing Tracking**

The food truck industry in South Carolina is characterized by continuous growth and change. Therefore, any count represents a snapshot in time. Ongoing monitoring, periodic data refreshes, and a commitment to systematic data collection are essential for maintaining an accurate and relevant understanding of the sector's size, economic contribution, and evolution. The recent shift in primary regulatory authority to the SCDA presents a significant opportunity for future data centralization. This could substantially ease the burden of tracking and quantifying this important and growing segment of South Carolina's economy, fostering better policy decisions and supporting industry growth.
