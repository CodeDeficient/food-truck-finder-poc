# Risk Register for Food Truck Finder Web App

This document outlines known risks associated with the Food Truck Finder web application, along with their descriptions, potential impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Known Risks

### API Limits

- **Description:** Exceeding rate limits or usage quotas for external APIs (e.g., Gemini, Firecrawl, Mapbox).
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (service disruption, increased costs)
- **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, caching, and monitor API usage.
- **Owner:** Backend/DevOps

### Data Quality

- **Description:** Inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated food truck data from scraping.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (poor user experience, unreliable information)
- **Mitigation:** Implement data validation, manual review processes, and data quality metrics.
- **Owner:** Data Pipeline/Admin

### Security

- **Description:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, or vulnerabilities in the application or Supabase.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (data loss, reputational damage, legal issues)
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust authentication/authorization (RLS), secure coding practices, regular security audits, and secret management.
- **Owner:** Security/DevOps

### Performance

- **Description:** Slow loading times, unresponsive UI, or inefficient backend queries.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (poor user experience, user churn)
- **Mitigation:** Optimize database queries, implement caching, use efficient components, and monitor performance metrics.
- **Owner:** Frontend/Backend

### Scalability

- **Description:** Inability of the application to handle increased user traffic or data volume.
- **Likelihood:** Low (currently) / Medium (future)
- **Impact:** High (service disruption, increased infrastructure costs)
- **Mitigation:** Design for horizontal scaling, use serverless functions, and leverage Supabase's scalable architecture.
- **Owner:** Architecture/DevOps

### Deployment

- **Description:** Issues during deployment, leading to downtime or broken features.
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium (service disruption, development delays)
- **Mitigation:** Implement CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and rollback strategies.
- **Owner:** DevOps

### Maintainability

- **Description:** Codebase becoming difficult to understand, modify, or extend over time.
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium (slow development, increased bug count)
- **Mitigation:** Adhere to coding standards (`CODEBASE_RULES.md`), conduct regular code reviews, and maintain clear documentation.
- **Owner:** Development Team
