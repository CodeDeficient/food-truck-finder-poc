# Accessibility Standards for UI Components

## Purpose
This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for ensuring that all UI components, with a focus on modals, meet accessibility standards, providing an inclusive user experience for all users.

## Accessibility Strategy
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Ensure all components adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA roles and semantics with meaningful labels.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure full keyboard access, including proper tab order and escape sequences.
- **Focus Management**: Implement consistent focus trapping and management, returning focus to logical starting point.
- **Visual Accessibility**: Maintain proper color contrast, high visibility even in high contrast mode.

## Modal Specific Guidelines
1. **ARIA Roles**: Apply relevant roles such as dialog, lertdialog, and ensure modal has ria-modal=true.
2. **Focus Management**: Focus should enter the modal when opened and return to the previous user interface element when closed.
3. **Keyboard Support**: Modal should close with the Escape key. Tab and Shift+Tab should navigate within modal elements.
4. **Screen Reader Speaks**: Ensure screen readers announce modal open, content changes, error messages, and other dynamic content.
5. **Loading and Status**: Use ria-busy and ole=alert for indicating loading states and important status messages.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Testing**: Use Modal.test.tsx for functional accessibility behavior.
- **Automated Tools**: REGULARLY test with tools like axe-core to identify any violations early.
- **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual tests using screen readers such as NVDA or JAWS, and ensure full keyboard navigation.
- **Visual Checks**: Ensure components render correctly in various themes and systems including dark mode and accessibility settings.
- **Performance**: Ensure no performance issues degrade usability by impacting timing or interactive response.

## Responsibility
- **UI Specialists**: Responsible for implementing and verifying compliance with these accessibility standards during the development and review process.
- **Verification Specialist**: Conducts final tests and verification prior to release.

## Related Rules
- **UI Development Conventions**: Ensure best practices from dev-conventions.md are followed.
- **Validation Protocols**: Cross-verify with zero-trust-post-action-verification-protocol.md for comprehensive coverage.

## Updates
- **2025-08-03**: Formalization of the accessibility standards for modals, reflecting comprehensive work done on unifying modal component system implementation.

## Conclusion
Accessibility for all UI components is a critical aspect ensuring usability for every user. Following these guidelines guarantees compliance with industry-standard practices while fostering an inclusive experience for all users.
