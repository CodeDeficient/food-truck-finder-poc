# Modal Component System Guidelines

## Brief overview
This rule set outlines key practices and standards for implementing and maintaining the Modal Component System across the food-truck-finder application. This ensures consistency, accessibility, and performance in all modal usages and future developments.

## Development Workflow
- **Unified Modal Usage**: Replace all Modal implementations with the unified Modal component, selecting the appropriate variant (simple, content, orm, confirmation).
 
- **Consistent API**: Use the provided 	ypes.ts and hooks.tsx for type safety and state management. Ensure all modals adhere to the standardized API.

- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all modals comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, using proper ARIA roles, focus management, and keyboard navigation.
 
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor modal render times to maintain thresholds: simple < 50ms, content < 100ms, orm < 75ms, large content < 200ms.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Select the Appropriate Variant**:
   - simple for basic alerts or confirmations.
   - content for complex content and custom layouts.
   - orm for input and submission interactions.
   - confirmation for critical action confirmations.

2. **Import and Implement Modal**:
   `	ypescript
   import { Modal } from '@/components/ui/Modal';
   
   const modal = useModal();
   
   return (
     <Modal
       variant="simple"
       isOpen={modal.isOpen}
       onClose={modal.close}
       title="Alert"
       actions={[
         { label: 'Close', onClick: modal.close }
       ]}
     />
   );
   `

3. **Ensure Accessibility**:
   - Utilize focus trapping, escape to close, and accessible labels.

4. **Test Diligently**:
   - Run unit, performance, and accessibility tests for all implementations.

## Validation Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Every modal must have 100% test coverage using Modal.test.tsx resources.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Validate with axe-core to ensure WCAG compliance. Reference Modal.accessibility.test.tsx.
- **Visual Regression**: Maintain UI consistency using snapshot tests in Modal.visual.test.tsx.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Use Modal.performance.test.tsx to ensure optimal rendering.

## Logging & Monitoring
- Monitor errors and performance metrics regularly. Log errors for real-time feedback and analytics.

## Related Rules
- **Component Props Validation**: Refer to component-props-validation.md for enforcing type safety and prop validation.
- **Component Deduplication**: Ensure no duplicate modal implementations per component-deduplication.md.

## Conclusion
The unified Modal Component System ensures maintainability and scalability in the food-truck-finder application. Adhering to these guidelines will provide a consistent and accessible user experience.

## Latest Change Log
- **2025-08-03**: Initial creation and documentation of unified modal system.
