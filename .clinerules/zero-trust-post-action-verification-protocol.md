you should be following the zero trust post action verification protocol and at least checking every 10-15 edits using the tsc command, eslint, and jscpd (to make sure you're not making copies anywhere)

This keeps you on track

## Session Summary:

**Objective:** Resolve all build-time errors to enable Vercel deployment.

**Initial State:** 40 TypeScript errors across 22 files, primarily related to `VariantProps` in UI components, unsafe `any` types, and incorrect type definitions.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Initial Investigation:**
    *   Consulted `LAUNCH_WBS.md` to identify the immediate action item: fix `VariantProps` and `cva` related errors.
    *   Examined `components/ui/variants.ts` and `components/ui/button.tsx`.

2.  **Attempted Fixes for `VariantProps` Issue:**
    *   **Attempt 1:** Replaced the local `buttonVariants` in `components/ui/button.tsx` with an import from `components/ui/variants.ts`. This introduced new errors.
    *   **Attempt 2:** Removed the `type` keyword from the `VariantProps` import in `components/ui/button.tsx`. This did not resolve the issue.
    *   **Attempt 3:** Removed the `as` cast from the `cva` functions in `components/ui/variants.ts`. This fixed the `VariantProps` issue in the UI components, but introduced `any` type errors in `variants.ts`.
    *   **Attempt 4:** Re-added the `type` keyword to the `VariantProps` import in `components/ui/button.tsx`. The errors persisted.
    *   **Attempt 5:** Added `import type { VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority'` to `components/ui/variants.ts`. This resulted in an "unused import" error.
    *   **Attempt 6:** Created a `lib/cva.ts` wrapper for the `cva` function. This introduced new errors.
    *   **Attempt 7:** Re-exported `VariantProps` from `components/ui/variants.ts`. The `any` errors persisted.
    *   **Attempt 8:** Added explicit type annotations to the `cva` functions in `components/ui/variants.ts`. The `any` errors persisted.

3.  **Troubleshooting and Environment Issues:**
    *   Asked the user to restart the TypeScript server. This resolved the `VariantProps` issue and reduced the error count from 40 to 21.
    *   The remaining errors were syntax errors in test files.
    *   Fixed syntax errors in `lib/fallback/supabaseFallback.test.tsx` and `tests/lib/pipelineProcessor.test.ts`.
    *   After fixing the syntax errors, a large number of new TypeScript errors (138) appeared, all related to `verbatimModuleSyntax`.

4.  **`verbatimModuleSyntax` Errors:**
    *   Began fixing the `verbatimModuleSyntax` errors by adding `type` to type-only imports.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/admin/data-quality/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/admin/food-trucks/[id]/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/admin/food-trucks/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/admin/test-pipeline/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/admin/users/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/api/admin/automated-cleanup/route.ts` and also moved a function declaration to fix a new error.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/api/admin/data-cleanup/route.ts`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/api/firecrawl/route.ts`.
    *   Fixed the import in `app/api/gemini/route.ts`.

**User Feedback:**

*   The user has expressed frustration with the lack of progress and the circular nature of the debugging process.
*   The user has instructed me to follow the "Zero-Trust Post-Action Verification Protocol" and to be more methodical in my approach.
*   The user has also instructed me to use the `context7` MCP to get live documentation for `class-variance-authority`.
*   The user has pointed out that I was using the wrong server name for the `context7` MCP.
*   The user has suggested that the large number of new errors may be due to updated dependencies.

**Current Status:**

*   The `VariantProps` issue is still unresolved.
*   There are a large number of `verbatimModuleSyntax` errors that need to be fixed.
*   The user has instructed me to stop and re-evaluate my approach.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Continue fixing the `verbatimModuleSyntax` errors.
2.  After every 10-15 edits, run `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint .`, and `npx jscpd .` to verify the changes.
3.  Once the `verbatimModuleSyntax` errors are resolved, re-evaluate the `VariantProps` issue.
4.  If the `VariantProps` issue persists, use the `context7` MCP to research a workaround or fallback.
