# Documentation Archive Notice

## Purpose

This notice explains the archival of redundant and outdated documentation files as part of the comprehensive documentation reorganization completed on **August 5, 2025**.

## What Was Archived

The following files have been moved to `docs_v2/_archive/2025-08-05/` while maintaining their original path structure:

### Archived Files:
- `UI_SPECIALIST_2_DELIVERABLES_MANIFEST.md` (root level)
- `app/admin/README.md`
- `components/auth/README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/blog/README.md`
- `docs/error-handling/README.md`
- `docs/mockups/README.md`
- `scripts/README.md`
- `staging/ui-specialist-1/README.md`
- `tests/README.md`

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were identified as:
- **Redundant**: Duplicate content that exists in better form elsewhere
- **Outdated**: Information that is no longer current or relevant
- **Non-primary**: Secondary documentation that has been superseded by the new structure

## Current Documentation

**ðŸŽ¯ For all current documentation, please refer to the new organized structure in `docs_v2/`**

The new documentation structure provides:
- **Clear categorization** by function (project overview, getting started, architecture, etc.)
- **Up-to-date content** aligned with the current project state
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all project aspects
- **Consistent formatting** and navigation
