- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **Mapping**: Leaflet, React-Leaflet
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Shadcn UI
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Jest (Unit/Integration)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript

## Features

- **Food Truck Discovery**: Easily find food trucks based on location, cuisine type, and operating status.
- **Detailed Information**: View comprehensive details for each food truck, including menus, operating hours, contact information, and social media links.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get live updates on food truck locations and availability.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Robust search capabilities with filters for cuisine type, price range, and operating status.
- **Event & Schedule Management**: Integration for food truck events and operating schedules.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized user profiles for enhanced experience.
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Built-in functions and dashboards to monitor and ensure data quality.
- **Comprehensive Security**: Implemented security hardening measures across the application and database.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A secure and comprehensive interface for administrators, currently under active development. It includes:
  - **Food Truck Management**: CRUD operations for food truck data.
  - **User Management**: Oversee and manage user accounts.
  - **Data Pipeline Monitoring**: Track scraping jobs, data quality, and automated cleanup processes.
  - **System Metrics & Alerts**: Real-time monitoring of application performance and system health, with configurable alerts.
  - **Analytics**: Insights into application usage and food truck popularity.
  - **Test Pipeline**: Tools for testing data scraping and processing pipelines.

## AI-Powered Data Pipeline

The backbone of the Food Truck Finder is its intelligent, automated data pipeline. This system is responsible for discovering, processing, and storing food truck data from various online sources.

### Key Components:

- **Tavily AI for Intelligent Discovery**: The pipeline uses Tavily's AI-powered search API to intelligently discover new food trucks and their websites. This allows for a more efficient and targeted approach to data acquisition compared to traditional web scraping.
- **Firecrawl for Web Scraping**: Once a potential food truck website is identified, Firecrawl is used to reliably scrape the necessary data, such as menus, operating hours, and contact information. Firecrawl's robust infrastructure ensures a high success rate and handles the complexities of web scraping.
- **Gemini AI for Data Extraction**: The scraped data is then processed by Google's Gemini AI, which extracts and structures the information into a consistent format.
- **Supabase for Data Storage**: The cleaned and structured data is stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database, providing a reliable and scalable data storage solution.

### Browser Debugging with browser-tools-mcp

This project uses [browser-tools-mcp](https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp) for local browser-based debugging and inspection. To use:

1.  Open the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2.  Search for and run `Browser Tools: Open Browser`.
3.  Use the browser window to interact with your app at `http://localhost:3000` (or your dev server URL).
4.  Use the browser-tools-mcp sidebar for DOM inspection, console, network, and accessibility audits.

See the [browser-tools-mcp documentation](https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp) for advanced features and troubleshooting.

### Pre-commit Hooks with Husky and lint-staged

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run linters on staged files, ensuring code quality and consistency before commits.

**How it works:**

- When you attempt to commit changes, Husky triggers the pre-commit hook.
- The pre-commit hook executes `pnpm exec lint-staged`.
- `lint-staged` then runs configured linters (`eslint --fix` and `prettier --write`) only on the files you've staged for commit.
- This process helps catch errors and enforce formatting standards automatically before code is added to the repository.

**Setup:**

1.  Husky and `lint-staged` are installed as dev dependencies.
2.  Husky is initialized (via `pnpm husky init` or automatically by the `prepare` script in `package.json`).
3.  The `.husky/pre-commit` hook is configured to run `pnpm exec lint-staged`.
4.  The `lint-staged` configuration in `package.json` specifies which commands to run on which file types.
