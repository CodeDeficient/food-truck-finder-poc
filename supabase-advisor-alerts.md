| multiple_permissive_policies | Multiple Permissive Policies | WARN  | EXTERNAL | ["PERFORMANCE"] | Detects if multiple permissive row level security policies are present on a table for the same \`role\` and \`action\` (e.g. insert). Multiple permissive policies are suboptimal for performance as each policy must be executed for every relevant query. | Table \`public.food_trucks\` has multiple permissive policies for role \`authenticated\` for action \`UPDATE\`. Policies include \`{"Admins can manage all trucks","Enhanced admin access to food_trucks","Food truck owners can update their own trucks"}\`                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0006_multiple_permissive_policies | {"name":"food_trucks","type":"table","schema":"public"}    | multiple_permissive_policies_public_food_trucks_authenticated_UPDATE                |
