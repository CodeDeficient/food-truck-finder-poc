const clearCacheInstructions = `
To clear the cached food truck data:

1. Open your localhost site in the browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Run this command:

localStorage.removeItem('food-trucks-cache');
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.startsWith('food-truck-')) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
console.log('âœ… Cache cleared! Refresh the page to fetch fresh data.');

Alternatively, you can:
- Go to Application/Storage tab in DevTools
- Expand "Local Storage" 
- Click on your localhost URL
- Delete the keys:
  * food-trucks-cache
  * Any keys starting with "food-truck-"

Then refresh the page to fetch fresh data from Supabase.
