## 🎭 Jennifer's Story & Mission

Jennifer's journey to founding Uprooted Vegan Cuisine began with a life-changing diagnosis. In 2004, she was diagnosed with renal failure, which led her to adopt a vegan lifestyle in 2010. The results were remarkable - her kidney function improved dramatically, inspiring her to share the benefits of plant-based eating with others.

"Uprooted" means more than just plants. Two years before her life-saving kidney transplant, Jennifer uprooted her life from Western New York to Aiken, South Carolina, to support her daughter's education. This leap led to Uprooted Vegan Cuisine - a business that challenges the stereotype of vegan food as bland "sticks and twigs."

**Mission:** "At Uprooted Vegan Cuisine, we believe in the power of plants—not just to nourish the body, but to support the community and the planet."
