- **B:** Refactor to maintain a single source of truth
- **C:** Test for consistency and appearance

### Task 2: Badge Repositioning
- **A:** Identify conflicting UI elements
- **B:** Reposition badge for clarity
- **C:** Conduct visual accessibility checks

### Task 3: Pin Redesign
- **A:** Redesign pins with aesthetic improvements
- **B:** Adjust shadow density and pin proximity
- **C:** Implement changes and validate on map interface

## Phase 2: Data Quality & Error Handling

### Task 1: Data Validation
- **A:** Implement checks for critical missing details (e.g., phone numbers)
- **B:** Introduce validation logic to enforce data completeness
- **C:** Monitor and log validation errors

### Task 2: Error Handling
- **A:** Develop error catchments for missing critical fields
- **B:** Standardize error presentation on frontend
- **C:** Test flows with missing data scenarios

### Task 3: Location Accuracy
