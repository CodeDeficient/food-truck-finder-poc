# Monitoring and Alerting Plan

This document outlines how to monitor the performance of the Food Truck Finder application and its data pipeline, as well as how to handle any issues that may arise.

## 1. Monitoring

### 1.1. Application Performance (Future Goal)

The application's performance will be monitored using [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics). Vercel Analytics provides real-time insights into the application's traffic, performance, and user demographics. This has not yet been implemented.

### 1.2. Data Pipeline Performance (Implemented)

The data pipeline's performance is monitored using the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard provides a real-time view of the pipeline's status, including the number of URLs that have been processed, the number of errors that have occurred, and the average processing time.

### 1.3. Database Performance (Implemented)

The database's performance is monitored using the Supabase dashboard. The Supabase dashboard provides a real-time view of the database's health, including the number of active connections, the CPU utilization, and the memory usage.

## 2. Alerting (Future Goal)

The following alerting capabilities are planned for the future but have not yet been implemented.

### 2.1. Application Errors

The application will be configured to send alerts to a designated email address whenever an unhandled error occurs.

### 2.2. Data Pipeline Errors

The data pipeline will be configured to send alerts to a designated email address whenever an error occurs during the processing of a URL.

### 2.3. Database Errors

The database will be configured to send alerts to a designated email address whenever a critical error occurs, such as a database connection failure.

## 3. Escalation Procedures

If an alert is received, the following escalation procedures should be followed:

1.  **Acknowledge the Alert:** The person who receives the alert should acknowledge it to let the rest of the team know that they are working on it.
2.  **Investigate the Issue:** The person who is working on the issue should investigate the root cause of the problem.
3.  **Resolve the Issue:** The person who is working on the issue should resolve the problem as quickly as possible.
4.  **Communicate the Resolution:** Once the issue has been resolved, the person who worked on it should communicate the resolution to the rest of the team.
