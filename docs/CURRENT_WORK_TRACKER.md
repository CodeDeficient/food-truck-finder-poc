# Current Work Tracker

**Date**: August 1, 2025
**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ ADMIN ROUTES STABILIZED - Vercel Prerender Issues Resolved! ðŸŽ‰

## Today's Major Accomplishments âœ…

### Admin Route Dynamic Rendering âœ…
- **Restored SSR-Only Rendering**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all admin routes to prevent Vercel prerender from invoking Supabase and external services during build
  - `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/data-quality/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/events/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/food-trucks/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/food-trucks/[id]/page.tsx` - âœ…
  - `app/admin/pipeline/page.tsx` - âœ…
- **Verified Supabase Client Safety**: Confirmed all admin routes use server-only Supabase imports and follow security best practices
- **ESM Import Compliance**: Ensured all admin routes follow ESM import best practices with explicit `.js` extensions and no directory imports

### Vercel Deployment Stability âœ…
- **Prerender Error Prevention**: Eliminated build-time Supabase access that was causing prerender bailout errors
- **Zero-Trust Verification**: Completed full verification cycle (TypeScript, ESLint, jscpd) to ensure no regressions
- **Admin Route Checklist**: Fully completed `docs/WBS_ADMIN_DYNAMIC_RENDERING_CHECKLIST.md` with all tasks verified

## Tomorrow's Focus ðŸŽ¯

### Remote GitHub Actions Implementation
1. **Workflow Deployment**: Get the remote GitHub Actions workflows functioning properly
2. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure all secrets and environment variables are properly configured in GitHub
3. **Branch Management**: Implement proper testing protocols using `gh workflow run --ref`
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure monitoring and alerting for the remote pipeline
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune job processing rates and resource utilization

## Key Success Factors for Tomorrow
- Test thoroughly with `gh workflow run scrape-food-trucks.yml --ref feature/branch-name`
- Verify all environment variables are properly set in GitHub Actions secrets
- Monitor job processing behavior and adjust as needed
- Continue using the ESM best practices established previously

## Blockers/Issues to Watch
- Potential discrepancies between local and remote environment configurations
- GitHub Actions rate limiting or timeout issues
- Supabase connection issues in the remote environment
- Resource constraints in the GitHub Actions runner environment
