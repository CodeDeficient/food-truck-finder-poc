# Current Work Tracker

**Date**: August 3, 2025
**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MILESTONE COMPLETED - Authentication & RBAC Next! ðŸŽ‰

## Latest Major Accomplishments âœ…

### Environment Variable Resolution Milestone (August 3, 2025) âœ…
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Automated dotenv-expand solution implemented and working
- **Database Connectivity Restored**: 85 food trucks now loading successfully (was "Failed to load food trucks")
- **Supabase API Key Management**: Legacy key lifecycle properly managed, new keys working in production
- **Production Deployment Fixed**: Vercel builds working consistently without environment variable issues
- **Authentication UI Complete**: Sign-in modal implemented and ready for backend integration
- **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Systematic debugging using Supabase CLI revealed disabled legacy keys
- **Automated Solution Deployed**: dotenv-expand package handles variable expansion automatically

### Foundation Stability Achievements âœ…
- **Zero TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Build guaranteed to succeed
- **Admin Routes Stabilized**: Dynamic rendering prevents Vercel prerender issues
- **ESM Import Compliance**: All routes follow ESM best practices
- **Core Features Working**: Food truck discovery, mapping, search all functional
- **Database Integration**: Supabase with fallback systems operational

## Current Focus ðŸŽ¯

### Authentication & Role-Based Access Control Implementation
1. **Authentication System Setup**: Complete RBAC for Users, Food Truck Owners, and Admin roles
2. **Backend Integration**: Connect sign-in modal to Supabase Auth
3. **Middleware Implementation**: Protect admin routes with proper role checking
4. **User Profile Management**: Basic user accounts and preferences
5. **Admin Dashboard Security**: Secure admin access with proper authorization

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks priority)
1. **CRON Job Investigation**: Critical issue - jobs report success but data not persisting (82 stuck "running" jobs)
2. **Production Stability Verification**: Test core user flows (search, map, details)
3. **Admin Security Implementation**: Move beyond simple password to proper RBAC
4. **User Feedback System**: Implement feedback collection for beta testing

## Critical Issues to Address
- **CRON Job Data Persistence**: Auto-scrape reports "79 trucks processed, 70 new" but only 9 in database
- **Stuck Scraping Jobs**: 82 jobs stuck in "running" status for weeks
- **Data Pipeline Verification**: Ensure scraping actually persists to production database

## Success Metrics
- [x] Environment variable issues resolved
- [x] 85 food trucks loading successfully
- [x] Zero build errors maintained
- [x] Production deployment stable
- [ ] CRON jobs completing successfully
- [ ] Authentication system implemented
- [ ] Admin dashboard secured
