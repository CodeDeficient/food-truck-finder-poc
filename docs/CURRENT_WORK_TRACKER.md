**Date**: August 1, 2025
**Status**: 🎉 ADMIN ROUTES STABILIZED - Vercel Prerender Issues Resolved! 🎉

## Today's Major Accomplishments ✅

### Admin Route Dynamic Rendering ✅
- **Restored SSR-Only Rendering**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all admin routes to prevent Vercel prerender from invoking Supabase and external services during build
  - `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/data-quality/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/events/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/food-trucks/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/food-trucks/[id]/page.tsx` - ✅
  - `app/admin/pipeline/page.tsx` - ✅
- **Verified Supabase Client Safety**: Confirmed all admin routes use server-only Supabase imports and follow security best practices
- **ESM Import Compliance**: Ensured all admin routes follow ESM import best practices with explicit `.js` extensions and no directory imports

### Vercel Deployment Stability ✅
- **Prerender Error Prevention**: Eliminated build-time Supabase access that was causing prerender bailout errors
- **Zero-Trust Verification**: Completed full verification cycle (TypeScript, ESLint, jscpd) to ensure no regressions
- **Admin Route Checklist**: Fully completed `docs/WBS_ADMIN_DYNAMIC_RENDERING_CHECKLIST.md` with all tasks verified

## Tomorrow's Focus 🎯

### Remote GitHub Actions Implementation
1. **Workflow Deployment**: Get the remote GitHub Actions workflows functioning properly
2. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure all secrets and environment variables are properly configured in GitHub
3. **Branch Management**: Implement proper testing protocols using `gh workflow run --ref`
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure monitoring and alerting for the remote pipeline
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune job processing rates and resource utilization

## Key Success Factors for Tomorrow
- Test thoroughly with `gh workflow run scrape-food-trucks.yml --ref feature/branch-name`
- Verify all environment variables are properly set in GitHub Actions secrets
- Monitor job processing behavior and adjust as needed
- Continue using the ESM best practices established previously

## Blockers/Issues to Watch
- Potential discrepancies between local and remote environment configurations
- GitHub Actions rate limiting or timeout issues
- Supabase connection issues in the remote environment
- Resource constraints in the GitHub Actions runner environment

**Date**: August 3, 2025
**Status**: 🎉 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MILESTONE COMPLETED - Authentication & RBAC Next! 🎉

## Latest Major Accomplishments ✅

### Environment Variable Resolution Milestone (August 3, 2025) ✅
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Automated dotenv-expand solution implemented and working
- **Database Connectivity Restored**: 85 food trucks now loading successfully (was "Failed to load food trucks")
- **Supabase API Key Management**: Legacy key lifecycle properly managed, new keys working in production
- **Production Deployment Fixed**: Vercel builds working consistently without environment variable issues
- **Authentication UI Complete**: Sign-in modal implemented and ready for backend integration
- **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Systematic debugging using Supabase CLI revealed disabled legacy keys
- **Automated Solution Deployed**: dotenv-expand package handles variable expansion automatically

### Foundation Stability Achievements ✅
- **Zero TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Build guaranteed to succeed
- **Admin Routes Stabilized**: Dynamic rendering prevents Vercel prerender issues
- **ESM Import Compliance**: All routes follow ESM best practices
- **Core Features Working**: Food truck discovery, mapping, search all functional
- **Database Integration**: Supabase with fallback systems operational

## Current Focus 🎯

### Authentication & Role-Based Access Control Implementation
1. **Authentication System Setup**: Complete RBAC for Users, Food Truck Owners, and Admin roles
2. **Backend Integration**: Connect sign-in modal to Supabase Auth
3. **Middleware Implementation**: Protect admin routes with proper role checking
4. **User Profile Management**: Basic user accounts and preferences
5. **Admin Dashboard Security**: Secure admin access with proper authorization

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks priority)
1. **CRON Job Investigation**: Critical issue - jobs report success but data not persisting (82 stuck "running" jobs)
2. **Production Stability Verification**: Test core user flows (search, map, details)
3. **Admin Security Implementation**: Move beyond simple password to proper RBAC
4. **User Feedback System**: Implement feedback collection for beta testing

## Critical Issues to Address
- **CRON Job Data Persistence**: Auto-scrape reports "79 trucks processed, 70 new" but only 9 in database
- **Stuck Scraping Jobs**: 82 jobs stuck in "running" status for weeks
- **Data Pipeline Verification**: Ensure scraping actually persists to production database

## Success Metrics
- [x] Environment variable issues resolved
- [x] 85 food trucks loading successfully
- [x] Zero build errors maintained
- [x] Production deployment stable
- [ ] CRON jobs completing successfully
- [ ] Authentication system implemented
- [ ] Admin dashboard secured
