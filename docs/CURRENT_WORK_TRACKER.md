# Current Work Tracker

**Date**: July 30, 2025
**Status**: Local Pipeline Success - Remote GitHub Actions Tomorrow

## Today's Major Accomplishments âœ…

### Local GitHub Actions Pipeline âœ…
- **ESM Import Resolution**: Fixed all `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT` and `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors
  - Added explicit `.js` file extensions to all relative imports
  - Eliminated directory imports in favor of specific file paths
  - Implemented proper dynamic imports for modules requiring environment variables
- **Environment Variable Loading**: Resolved module initialization failures
  - Load dotenv configuration BEFORE importing dependent modules
  - Use dynamic imports (`await import()`) for modules requiring environment variables
  - Added comprehensive environment variable validation
- **Pending Jobs Fetching**: Eliminated inconsistencies between local and GitHub Actions
  - Implemented proper branch management using `gh` CLI with `--ref` option
  - Added comprehensive logging to verify job counts and status filtering
- **Duplicate Job Prevention**: Implemented robust duplicate detection and cleanup
  - Created diagnostic scripts (`check-duplicate-jobs.js`) to identify duplicates
  - Developed cleanup scripts (`cleanup-duplicate-jobs.js`) to remove redundant jobs
  - Added early duplicate checking in the scraping pipeline

### Documentation âœ…
- Updated `.clinerules/operational-learnings.md` with 4 new GitHub Actions rules
- Created `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md` documenting local pipeline success
- Created blog post `docs/blog/2025-07-30-github-actions-pipeline-success.md`

## Tomorrow's Focus ðŸŽ¯

### Remote GitHub Actions Implementation
1. **Workflow Deployment**: Get the remote GitHub Actions workflows functioning properly
2. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure all secrets and environment variables are properly configured in GitHub
3. **Branch Management**: Implement proper testing protocols using `gh workflow run --ref`
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure monitoring and alerting for the remote pipeline
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune job processing rates and resource utilization

## Key Success Factors for Tomorrow
- Test thoroughly with `gh workflow run scrape-food-trucks.yml --ref feature/branch-name`
- Verify all environment variables are properly set in GitHub Actions secrets
- Monitor job processing behavior and adjust as needed
- Continue using the ESM best practices established today

## Blockers/Issues to Watch
- Potential discrepancies between local and remote environment configurations
- GitHub Actions rate limiting or timeout issues
- Supabase connection issues in the remote environment
- Resource constraints in the GitHub Actions runner environment
