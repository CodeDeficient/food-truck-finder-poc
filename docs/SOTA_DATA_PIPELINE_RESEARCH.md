## Executive Summary

This document summarizes State-of-the-Art (SOTA) best practices for large scale data pipelines, particularly relevant to our food truck finder project's web scraping and AI processing pipeline. The research covers key areas including general data pipeline best practices, scalable architecture, Tavily API usage for web scraping, and GitHub Actions workflow optimization. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and efficient data pipeline that will support the growth of the Food Truck Finder project while maintaining high data quality and system reliability.

## Key Findings

### 1. General Best Practices for Building Scalable Data Pipelines

Based on research from multiple sources including "10 Best Practices for Building Scalable Data Pipelines" and "Architecting a Scalable and High-Performance Data Pipeline".

#### Foundational Principles
- **Start with Clear Business Objectives**: Ensure every part of the pipeline serves a specific, well-defined business goal.
- **Choose the Right Technology Stack**: Select tools (e.g., Polars, Dask, DuckDB for large datasets) that fit the specific needs of the project, considering factors like setup, learning curve, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Design for Scalability from the Beginning**: Don't treat scalability as an afterthought. Build with growth in mind.
- **Use a Modular Architecture**: Break the pipeline into smaller, independent, and reusable components (e.g., ingestion, transformation, storage, monitoring). This simplifies development, testing, and maintenance.

#### Implementation Best Practices
- **Automate Testing and Monitoring**: Implement automated testing at every stage of the pipeline to ensure data quality and integrity. Continuous monitoring helps identify and resolve issues proactively.
- **Ensure Data Quality Throughout the Pipeline**: Implement validation, cleansing, and transformation rules to maintain high data quality from source to destination.
- **Use Distributed Systems**: For handling large volumes of data, leverage distributed systems and parallel processing to improve performance and scalability.
- **Data Governance and Security**: Implement strong data governance practices, including access control, encryption (at rest and in transit), and compliance with data privacy regulations.

### 2. Tavily API Best Practices for Web Scraping

Based on Tavily documentation and best practices:

#### Search API Optimization
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate delays and respect site's robots.txt
- **Concurrent Requests**: Use `async/await` and `asyncio.gather` for non-blocking requests
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic and graceful failure handling
- **Result Filtering**: Use regex patterns to filter and prioritize relevant content

#### Crawl API Best Practices
- **Start Small**: Begin with limited depth and breadth, gradually increase
- **Be Specific**: Use path patterns (`select_paths`, `exclude_paths`) to focus crawling
- **Optimize Resources**: Choose appropriate `extract_depth` and set reasonable limits
- **Handle Errors**: Implement retry logic and monitor failed results

#### Extract API Recommendations
- **Two-step Process**: Search first, then extract for better accuracy
- **Advanced Extraction**: Use `advanced` depth only when needed (higher cost)
- **Content Validation**: Validate extracted content before processing

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization

Based on GitHub Actions best practices and scheduling research:

#### Scheduling Best Practices
- **Cron Optimization**: Schedule workflows at off-peak times (15 and 45 minutes past the hour)
- **External Triggers**: Consider external schedulers for critical production tasks
- **Multiple Schedules**: Use multiple schedule triggers for different time patterns

#### Performance Optimization
- **Concurrency Control**: Define concurrency groups to cancel in-progress jobs when new ones start
- **Timeout Settings**: Set explicit `timeout-minutes` (30 minutes recommended for most use cases)
- **Queue Management**: Use warm pools of pre-registered runners to reduce wait times
- **Resource Management**: Scale runner sets to zero during off-hours to reduce costs

#### Workflow Design
- **Conditional Execution**: Execute jobs based on file changes to avoid unnecessary runs
- **Dependency Management**: Use `jobs.<job-id>.needs` for sequential execution when required
- **Caching**: Cache API schemas and dependencies to reduce initialization time

## Recommendations for Food Truck Finder Pipeline

### 1. Pipeline Architecture Improvements

#### Current State Analysis
Our current pipeline has successfully implemented:
- ✅ Enhanced duplicate prevention with Unicode normalization
- ✅ Intelligent data filtering and quality scoring
- ✅ Proper invalid data handling (no more "Unknown Food Truck" entries)
- ✅ URL quality management with pre-filtering and scoring

#### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Modular Architecture**: Continue to separate discovery, scraping, and processing into distinct, single-responsibility services.
2. **Streaming Processing**: For high-priority updates (e.g., a truck's location for the day), consider implementing a real-time or near-real-time streaming component.
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement a comprehensive monitoring dashboard with metrics on pipeline performance, data quality, and costs.
4. **Automated Scaling**: Design the pipeline to scale horizontally as the volume of data and processing jobs increases.

### 2. Tavily Integration Strategy for Job Queuing

#### Recommended Approach
1. **Discovery Phase (Search API)**:
   - Use Tavily's Search API to discover potential food truck websites, social media pages, and event calendars.
   - The query should be broad enough to find new sources but specific enough to avoid irrelevant results.
   - The results of this search will be a list of URLs to be scraped.
2. **Queuing Pending Jobs**:
   - The discovered URLs should be added to a 'pending_jobs' queue in our Supabase database.
   - Each job should have a status (e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed'), a priority, and a retry count.
3. **Processing Phase (Extract API)**:
   - A separate worker process will pull jobs from the queue.
   - Use Tavily's Extract API to get the detailed content from the URL.
   - The extracted content is then passed to the Gemini API for data extraction and normalization.
4. **Rate Limiting and Batching**:
   - Implement proper delays between API calls to respect rate limits.
   - Group URLs into batches for efficient processing.

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization

#### Recommended Improvements
1. **Multiple Schedules**:
   - A high-frequency schedule (e.g., every 15-30 minutes) for the discovery and queuing process.
   - A separate, potentially less frequent, schedule for the processing of the jobs in the queue.
2. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Implement concurrency groups to ensure that only one discovery job and a set number of processing jobs run at a time.
   - Set appropriate timeouts to prevent jobs from running indefinitely.
3. **External Job Queue**:
   - For long-term scalability, consider moving from a simple database queue to a dedicated job queue service (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) for better control, monitoring, and scalability.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement Tavily Discovery and Queuing**:
   - Create the script to use Tavily's Search API for discovery.
   - Create the `pending_jobs` table in Supabase.
   - Implement the logic to add discovered URLs to the queue.
2. **GitHub Actions Optimization**:
   - Create the new GitHub Actions workflow for the discovery process.
   - Update the existing workflow to process jobs from the queue.
   - Add concurrency controls and timeouts.
3. **Monitoring Enhancement**:
   - Add detailed logging to all pipeline components.
   - Implement basic metrics tracking (e.g., number of jobs queued, processed, failed).
   - Set up failure notifications.

### Phase 2: Medium-term Enhancements (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Pipeline Architecture Refinement**:
   - Refactor the pipeline into more modular components.
   - Implement streaming processing for high-priority updates.
2. **Advanced Data Quality**:
   - Implement more advanced data quality checks and metrics.
   - Use machine learning to predict the quality of a URL before processing.

### Phase 3: Long-term Scalability (Next 3-6 months)
1. **Dedicated Job Queue**:
   - Migrate to a dedicated job queue service.
2. **Advanced Infrastructure**:
   - Implement warm runner pools for GitHub Actions.
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard for pipeline monitoring.
   - Implement automated scaling of processing workers based on queue size.

## Conclusion

The research confirms that our current pipeline improvements align well with SOTA best practices. The next steps should focus on implementing a robust discovery and queuing mechanism using Tavily, optimizing our GitHub Actions workflows, and enhancing our monitoring capabilities. This will provide a solid foundation for a scalable and reliable data pipeline.
