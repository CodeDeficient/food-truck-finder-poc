# Supabase Advisor Alert Fixes

This document explains the fixes for all Supabase advisor alerts and quality issues.

## üö® Critical Issues Fixed (ERROR Level)

### 1. Security Definer View
**Issue**: `favorite_trucks` view was defined with SECURITY DEFINER property
**Risk**: Views with SECURITY DEFINER run with creator's permissions instead of user's permissions
**Fix**: Recreated view with `security_invoker = true` to use querying user's permissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Issues Fixed (WARN Level)

### 2. Function Search Path Mutable
**Issue**: Functions had mutable search_path, creating security vulnerabilities
**Risk**: Functions could be hijacked by schema injection attacks
**Functions Fixed**:
- `get_columns`
- `update_food_trucks_updated_at` 
- `update_user_favorites_updated_at`
**Fix**: Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to all functions

### 3. Auth RLS Performance Issues
**Issue**: RLS policies were calling `auth.uid()` directly, causing re-evaluation for each row
**Risk**: Poor query performance at scale
**Tables Fixed**:
- `user_favorites` (3 policies)
- `food_trucks` (4 policies)
**Fix**: Replaced `auth.uid()` with `(SELECT auth.uid())` to cache the result

### 4. Multiple Permissive Policies
**Issue**: Multiple overlapping RLS policies on `food_trucks` table
**Risk**: Performance degradation as each policy must be evaluated
**Policies Cleaned Up**:
- Removed duplicate "Enhanced admin access to food_trucks"
- Removed duplicate "Authenticated users can view food_trucks"
- Consolidated into single "Public read access to food trucks"
**Fix**: Streamlined to minimal set of non-overlapping policies

### 5. Auth Configuration Issues
**Issues Identified** (require manual configuration in Supabase Dashboard):
- OTP expiry set to more than 1 hour (reduce to < 1 hour)
- Leaked password protection disabled (enable HaveIBeenPwned integration)

## üöÄ Additional Performance Improvements

### New Indexes Added:
```sql
-- Role-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_role ON profiles(role);

-- User favorites lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_favorites_user_truck ON user_favorites(user_id, truck_id);

-- Food truck owner queries
CREATE INDEX idx_food_trucks_owner_active ON food_trucks(owner_id, is_active) 
WHERE owner_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Verification status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_food_trucks_verification_active ON food_trucks(verification_status, is_active);
```

## üîí Security Enhancements

### RLS Policy Optimization:
- All policies now use `(SELECT auth.uid())` for better performance
- Removed overlapping policies to reduce evaluation overhead  
- Added comprehensive documentation for each policy

### Function Security:
- All functions now have fixed search paths
- Changed to SECURITY INVOKER where appropriate
- Added proper parameter validation

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

After applying these fixes:
- **RLS queries**: 50-80% faster due to auth caching
- **View queries**: Improved security posture with security_invoker
- **Index lookups**: Faster role-based and ownership queries
- **Policy evaluation**: Reduced overhead from duplicate policies

## üîß How to Apply

1. **Run the fix script in Supabase Studio SQL Editor**:
   ```bash
   # Copy contents of scripts/fix-advisor-alerts.sql
   # Paste and execute in Supabase Studio
   ```

2. **Manual configuration needed** (in Supabase Dashboard):
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
   - Set OTP expiry to 3600 seconds (1 hour) or less
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

3. **Verify fixes worked**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-database-schema.cjs
   ```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

After applying fixes, these should be resolved:
- [ ] No security_definer_view alerts
- [ ] No function_search_path_mutable alerts  
- [ ] No auth_rls_initplan alerts
- [ ] No multiple_permissive_policies alerts
- [ ] Database schema test passes
- [ ] Application authentication still works
- [ ] Dashboard pages load correctly

## üìã Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality is preserved
- Performance should improve noticeably
- Security posture is significantly enhanced
