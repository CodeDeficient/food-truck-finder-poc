## üõ°Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED LICENSE OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Business Source License (BSL) - RECOMMENDED** ‚≠ê

**What it does:**
- Allows free use for **non-commercial purposes**
- Blocks **commercial competitors** from using your code
- After 4 years, automatically becomes Apache 2.0 (open source)
- Used by: MongoDB, CockroachDB, Elastic

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Perfect protection against market saturation
- ‚úÖ Allows educational/personal use
- ‚úÖ Still appears "open source" to developers
- ‚úÖ Builds community while protecting business
- ‚úÖ Eventual open source conversion for long-term goodwill

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not technically "open source" (OSI-approved)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May confuse some developers initially

**Example BSL License Text:**
```
Business Source License 1.1

License Grant: You may use, modify, and distribute the licensed work, 
provided that you do not use it for Commercial Use.

Commercial Use means any use that is primarily intended for commercial 
advantage or monetary compensation, including but not limited to:
- Operating a food truck discovery service
- Providing location-based restaurant/food services
- Commercial data aggregation of food vendor information

Change Date: January 20, 2029 (4 years from now)
Change License: Apache License 2.0
```

### **Option 2: Commons Clause + MIT**

**What it does:**
- MIT license + "Commons Clause" addition
- Prevents **selling the software** but allows everything else
- More permissive than BSL

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler than BSL
- ‚úÖ Familiar MIT base
- ‚úÖ Prevents direct commercial sales

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less protection than BSL (allows commercial use, just not sales)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Competitors could still clone and offer for "free" while monetizing differently

### **Option 3: Dual Licensing (MIT + Commercial)**

**What it does:**
- Offer under MIT for open source use
- Require commercial license for business use
- Common in database and enterprise software

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum flexibility
- ‚úÖ Revenue opportunity from license sales
- ‚úÖ Clear legal framework

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex to implement and enforce
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires legal framework for commercial licenses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May limit adoption

### **Option 4: AGPL-3.0 (Strong Copyleft)**

**What it does:**
- Requires anyone using your code to open source their **entire application**
- Includes network use (SaaS applications)
- Very restrictive for commercial use

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Strong protection against proprietary competitors
- ‚úÖ Forces competitors to be open source too
- ‚úÖ True open source license

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May discourage legitimate contributors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Very restrictive even for snippet usage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't directly prevent market saturation

## üèÜ **FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Business Source License (BSL)**

### **Why BSL is Perfect for Your Situation:**

1. **Market Protection:** Prevents commercial food truck discovery clones
2. **Developer Friendly:** Allows snippet usage, learning, contributions
3. **Business Clarity:** Clear commercial vs. non-commercial distinction
4. **Future Planning:** Eventually becomes fully open source
5. **Industry Proven:** Used by successful tech companies

### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Create `LICENSE` file** with BSL 1.1 text
2. **Add copyright notice** to all source files
3. **Update README** with clear license explanation
4. **Add Contributing Guidelines** explaining the license choice
