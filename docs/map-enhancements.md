## Overview
Enhanced the map component to provide much better street names, city labels, and highway visibility for the food truck finder application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Tile Layers
- **Light Mode**: Switched from basic OpenStreetMap to CartoDB Positron
  - Much cleaner appearance
  - Clear street names and labels
  - Better highway visibility
  - Reduced visual clutter

- **Dark Mode**: Using CartoDB Dark Matter
  - Excellent readability with clear labels
  - Professional dark theme
  - Maintains street/city visibility

### 2. Performance Enhancements
- Hardware acceleration with `translateZ(0)`
- Smooth tile loading with fade animations
- Reduced choppy grid visibility
- Better zoom and pan animations
- Optimized tile buffering and loading

### 3. Enhanced Visual Quality
- Removed tile borders/grid lines
- Smooth transitions between tiles
- Better image rendering settings
- Enhanced marker styling with glows
- Improved popup styling

### 4. User Experience
- Smoother loading skeleton
- Better responsive design
- Enhanced touch controls for mobile
- Improved zoom controls styling

## Technical Details

### Tile Layer URLs
```javascript
// Light mode - CartoDB Positron
'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'

// Dark mode - CartoDB Dark Matter  
'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'
```

### Performance Settings
- `keepBuffer: 2` - Maintains tiles outside view for smoother panning
- `updateWhenIdle: true` - Updates only when user stops interacting
- `updateWhenZooming: false` - Prevents updates during zoom for smoothness
- Hardware acceleration on key elements

### CSS Enhancements
- Tile fade-in animations
- Hardware acceleration
- Smooth transitions
- Reduced visual noise during loading
- Enhanced marker hover effects

## Results
- **Street names**: Now clearly visible at all zoom levels
- **City labels**: Prominent and easy to read
- **Highways**: Well-defined and labeled
- **Performance**: Smoother, less choppy loading
- **Visual quality**: Professional appearance matching modern map UIs

## Future Enhancements
For advanced animations and transitions, consider:
- Framer Motion integration for marker animations
- Custom loading transitions
- Interactive map controls
- Advanced clustering for many markers
