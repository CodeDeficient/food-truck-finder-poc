# Finding Google OAuth in Supabase Dashboard

Based on your screenshot, it looks like Supabase has updated their interface. Here's how to find Google OAuth:

## Method 1: Look for "Social Providers" or "OAuth Providers"

Instead of the "Add provider" dropdown, look for:

1. **In the same Authentication > Providers page:**
   - Scroll down to see if there are more sections
   - Look for "Social Providers", "OAuth Providers", or "External Providers"
   - Google should be listed there with major providers like GitHub, Discord, etc.

2. **Check different tabs in Authentication:**
   - Look for additional tabs besides "Supabase Auth" and "Third Party Auth"
   - There might be a "Social" or "OAuth" tab

## Method 2: Look in the Main Providers List

Sometimes Google appears as a card/tile in the main providers area, not in the dropdown. Look for:

- Google logo/icon
- "Sign in with Google" option
- Social provider cards above or below the "Add provider" button

## Method 3: Check Supabase Documentation

If you can't find it in the UI:

1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google)
2. This will show you exactly where Google OAuth is located in the current interface

## Alternative: Use the Supabase CLI Method

If the UI is confusing, you can also enable Google OAuth via the CLI:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref zkwliyjjkdnigizidlln

# Enable Google OAuth
supabase secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
supabase secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## What NOT to Use

❌ **Don't use Firebase** - That's Google's competing service
❌ **Don't use Auth0** - That's a different auth service  
❌ **Don't use Clerk** - That's another third-party auth service

## What You're Looking For

✅ **Google** (with Google logo)
✅ **Sign in with Google** 
✅ **Google OAuth**
✅ Might be under "Social Providers" section

The providers in your dropdown (Firebase, Clerk, WorkOS, Auth0) are all third-party authentication services that would replace Supabase Auth entirely - that's not what we want.
