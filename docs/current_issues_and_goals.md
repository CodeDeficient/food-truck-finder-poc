## Recently Completed Improvements

### Data Quality & Pipeline Enhancements (July 29, 2025)
1.  **Data Quality: "Unknown Food Truck" Entries**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Implemented proper data validation to discard invalid entries instead of creating placeholder entries. Enhanced duplicate prevention system to handle Unicode character variations and case sensitivity.

2.  **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Created `scripts/safe-convert-discovered-to-jobs.js` to safely convert discovered URLs to pending scraping jobs with proper error handling and quality checks.

3.  **ESM Import Resolution Errors**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Implemented dynamic imports and proper environment variable loading before module imports. Created systematic import fixing scripts.

4.  **Duplicate Food Truck Entries**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Improved `lib/data-quality/duplicatePrevention.js` with advanced normalization to handle Unicode apostrophes, case sensitivity, and common food truck suffixes.

5.  **Supabase Migrations**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Fixed by proper environment variable configuration and migration file management.

6.  **Enhanced Duplicate Prevention System**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented sophisticated duplicate detection with Unicode normalization, fuzzy matching using Levenshtein distance, weighted scoring, and threshold-based merging. Ensured consistent logic between real-time and batch processing systems.

7.  **ESM/CJS Interop Improvements**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed module interop issues between ESM and CommonJS modules in data pipeline scripts.

8.  **Pending Job Duplication Problem**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Cleaned up 89 duplicate jobs from 39 URLs, reducing pending jobs from 139 to 50
    *   **Impact**: Eliminated significant resource waste and processing inefficiency
    *   **Solution**: Created `scripts/check-duplicate-jobs.js` and `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-jobs.js` for ongoing maintenance

9.  **GitHub Actions Dist Directory Consolidation**:
    *   **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - July 29, 2025
