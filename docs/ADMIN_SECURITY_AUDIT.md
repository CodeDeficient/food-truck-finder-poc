# Admin Security Audit

This document outlines the current admin security implementation and proposes additional verification steps to ensure that there are no loopholes.

## Current Implementation

The application uses Next.js middleware to protect the `/admin` routes. The `protectAdminRoutes` function in `lib/middleware/middlewareHelpers.ts` performs the following checks:

1.  **Session Verification:** It uses `createSupabaseMiddlewareClient` to get the user's session. If there is no session, it redirects the user to the `/login` page.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** It queries the `profiles` table to get the user's role. If the user's role is not `admin`, it redirects the user to the `/access-denied` page.
3.  **Audit Logging:** It uses an `AuditLogger` to log all access to the admin panel.

## Proposed Verification Steps

To ensure that there are no loopholes in the current implementation, I propose the following verification steps:

1.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**
    *   Attempt to access the `/admin` route directly without being logged in. The expected result is a redirect to the `/login` page.
    *   Log in as a non-admin user and attempt to access the `/admin` route directly. The expected result is a redirect to the `/access-denied` page.
2.  **Code Review:**
    *   Review the `protectAdminRoutes` function to ensure that there are no logic errors that could allow unauthorized access.
    *   Review the RLS policies on the `profiles` table to ensure that they are correctly configured and that there are no vulnerabilities.
3.  **Automated Testing:**
    *   Write E2E tests to simulate the manual penetration testing steps.
    *   Write integration tests to verify the behavior of the `protectAdminRoutes` function in isolation.
