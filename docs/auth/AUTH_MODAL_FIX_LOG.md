# AUTH_MODAL_FIX_LOG

- **Initial State:** 8 problems (6 errors, 2 warnings)
  - Issues ranging from unused variables, sonarjs warnings, no-misused-promises, and max function lines

- **Fix Process:**
  - Autofix to address simple linting errors
  - Fixed unused variables by prefixing required but unused with underscores
  - Replaced implicit checks with strict nullish checks
  - Removed redundant void statements and refactored code to follow conventions
  - Extracted logic to a "useAuthModal" custom hook for cleaner separation of concerns

- **Final State:** 1 minor warning (hook exceeding function length) 
  - All errors resolved, only remaining is refactoring verbosity

- **Verification:**
  - Passed ESLint checks
  - Passed TypeScript checks
  - Passed duplication checks
