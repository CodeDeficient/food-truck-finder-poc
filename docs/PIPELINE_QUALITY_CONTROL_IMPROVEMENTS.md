# Pipeline Quality Control Improvements - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive quality control improvements made to the food truck discovery pipeline to eliminate "Unknown Food Truck" entries, prevent duplicates, and improve overall data quality.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All quality control improvements have been successfully implemented and verified.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. "Unknown Food Truck" Problem
- **Root Cause**: Invalid data (null/empty names) was being stored instead of discarded
- **Solution**: Enhanced validation to properly discard trucks with null/empty names
- **Impact**: Eliminates placeholder entries that clutter the database

### 2. Duplicate Food Truck Prevention
- **Root Cause**: Unicode character variations and case sensitivity causing duplicate entries
- **Solution**: Enhanced name normalization and fuzzy matching
- **Impact**: Successfully resolved "Page's Okra Grill" duplicates and prevented future duplicates

### 3. Resource Waste from Non-Food Truck URLs
- **Root Cause**: Processing social media, event, and government sites that never contain food truck data
- **Solution**: Pre-filtering with comprehensive URL blacklisting
- **Impact**: Reduced API usage costs and processing time

### 4. Repeated Processing of Poor Quality URLs
- **Root Cause**: No mechanism to prevent re-processing failing URLs
- **Solution**: URL quality scoring and blacklisting system
- **Impact**: Prevents wasted resources on consistently failing URLs

## Implementation Details

### URL Quality Filtering

The pipeline now implements two-tier URL filtering:

#### 1. Pre-Filtering (isObviouslyNonFoodTruckUrl)
URLs that are obviously not related to food trucks are skipped entirely:

```javascript
const blacklistKeywords = [
    'facebook.com',
    'instagram.com',
    'twitter.com',
    'linkedin.com',
    'youtube.com',
    'yelp.com',
    'google.com',
    'maps.google.com',
    'foursquare.com',
    'tripadvisor.com',
    'zomato.com',
    'eventbrite.com',
    'meetup.com',
];

const nonFoodTruckPatterns = [
    /\/events?\//i,
    /\/festivals?\//i,
    /\/calendar/i,
    /\/blog/i,
    /\/news/i,
    /\/articles?\//i,
    /\/government/i,
    /\/city\.gov/i,
    /\/municipal/i,
    /\/reddit\.com/i,
];
```

#### 2. Smart Processing (isFoodTruckUrl)
URLs that pass pre-filtering are checked for food truck relevance:

```javascript
const foodTruckKeywords = [
    'food-truck',
    'foodtruck',
    'mobile-food',
    'street-food',
    'truck',
    'kitchen',
    'eats',
    'bbq',
    'burger',
    'taco',
    'catering',
    'mobile',
    'chef',
    'bistro',
    'cafe',
];
```

### URL Quality Scoring System

Each URL is tracked with quality metrics:

- **quality_score**: Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 (default: 0.5)
- **processing_attempts**: Number of times URL has been processed
- **last_processed_at**: Timestamp of last processing attempt

**Scoring Logic:**
- Success: Quality score increases by +0.2
- Failure: Quality score decreases by -0.3
- Blacklisting: URLs with quality_score < 0.3 and multiple failures are blacklisted

### Enhanced Duplicate Prevention

Implemented advanced name normalization and fuzzy matching to prevent duplicate entries:

```javascript
function normalizeFoodTruckName(name) {
    if (!name) return '';
    
    return name
        .toLowerCase()
        .trim()
        // Normalize apostrophes (handle different Unicode apostrophes)
        .replace(/[\u2018\u2019\u0060\u00B4]/g, "'")
        // Remove common food truck suffixes/prefixes
        .replace(/\s*(food\s+truck|food\s+trailer|mobile\s+kitchen|street\s+food|food\s+cart)\s*/gi, '')
        // Remove extra whitespace and normalize punctuation
        .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
        .replace(/[^\w\s&'-]/g, '')
        .trim();
}

// Advanced similarity calculation for fuzzy matching
function calculateSimilarity(name1, name2) {
    const normalized1 = normalizeFoodTruckName(name1);
    const normalized2 = normalizeFoodTruckName(name2);
    
    if (normalized1 === normalized2) return 1.0;
    
    // Check for substring matches
    if (normalized1.includes(normalized2) || normalized2.includes(normalized1)) {
        const ratio = Math.min(normalized1.length, normalized2.length) / Math.max(normalized1.length, normalized2.length);
        return 0.8 + (ratio * 0.15); // 0.8-0.95
    }
    
    // Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
    const distance = levenshteinDistance(normalized1, normalized2);
    const maxLength = Math.max(normalized1.length, normalized2.length);
    return 1 - (distance / maxLength);
}
```

### Data Validation Improvements

Enhanced validation in the scraping pipeline:

```javascript
// Before: Creating placeholder entries
if (!extractedData.name) {
    extractedData.name = 'Unknown Food Truck';
}

// After: Properly discarding invalid data
if (extractedData.name === null || extractedData.name === undefined || extractedData.name.trim() === '') {
    console.warn(`Job ${jobId}: Discarding truck from ${job.target_url} due to null/empty name.`);
    await ScrapingJobService.updateJobStatus(jobId, 'completed', {
        data_collected: extractedData,
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        notes: 'Discarded due to null/empty name - not a food truck website',
    });
    await updateUrlQualityScore(job.target_url, 'failure');
    return;
}
```

## Current System State

## Conclusion

These quality control improvements have transformed the food truck discovery pipeline from a system that created placeholder data to one that intelligently filters and processes only relevant, high-quality URLs. The result is a more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective data collection system that produces cleaner, more accurate food truck data.
