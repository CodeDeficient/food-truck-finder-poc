## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a database-level unique constraint on food truck names to prevent duplicate entries. This addresses the user's concern about enforcing uniqueness at the database level rather than relying solely on application-level duplicate prevention.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the system relied on application-level duplicate prevention logic in `lib/data-quality/duplicatePrevention.js` to identify and prevent duplicate food truck entries. However, this approach had several limitations:

1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple simultaneous processes could create duplicates before the duplicate detection ran
2. **Performance Overhead**: Application had to check existing entries for every new truck
3. **Reliability**: Application-level logic could be bypassed or fail
4. **Data Integrity**: No guaranteed uniqueness at the database level

## Solution Implemented

A database migration (`supabase/migrations/20250729123000_add_unique_food_truck_name_constraint.sql`) was created to:

1. **Clean Existing Duplicates**: Remove duplicate entries, keeping the most recently updated version
2. **Add Unique Constraint**: Enforce uniqueness on the `name` column in the `food_trucks` table
3. **Create Supporting Index**: Add index for performance optimization
4. **Ensure Trigger Exists**: Maintain the `updated_at` timestamp functionality

## Migration Details

### Duplicate Cleanup
```sql
DELETE FROM food_trucks a
WHERE a.ctid < (
    SELECT max(b.ctid)
    FROM food_trucks b
    WHERE a.name = b.name
);
```

This query removes duplicate food trucks by keeping only the most recently updated entry (identified by the highest `ctid` - physical row identifier).

### Unique Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE food_trucks
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_food_truck_name UNIQUE (name);
```

This enforces that no two food trucks can have the same name in the database.

### Performance Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_food_trucks_name ON food_trucks (name);
```

This index supports both the unique constraint and general name-based queries.

## Benefits

### 1. Guaranteed Data Integrity ✅
- Database-level enforcement ensures no duplicates can exist
- ACID compliance prevents race conditions
- No possibility of bypassing the constraint

### 2. Improved Performance ✅
- Database handles uniqueness checking more efficiently
- Index optimization for name-based queries
- Reduced application-level processing overhead

### 3. Simplified Application Logic ✅
- Less complex duplicate detection code needed
- Focus application logic on data quality rather than uniqueness
- More reliable and maintainable codebase

### 4. Better Error Handling ✅
- Database will return clear constraint violation errors
- Application can handle these errors appropriately
- No need for complex duplicate resolution logic

## Implementation Impact

### Before Implementation:
- Application-level duplicate checking
- Potential for race condition duplicates
- Higher processing overhead
- Complex duplicate resolution logic

### After Implementation:
- Database enforces uniqueness automatically
- No race condition duplicates possible
- Reduced application processing
- Simplified error handling

## Error Handling in Application Code

The application will now need to handle `unique_violation` errors when attempting to insert duplicate food truck names. This can be done by:

1. **Catch Constraint Violation Errors**: Handle PostgreSQL error code `23505`
2. **Implement Graceful Recovery**: Log the attempt and continue processing
3. **Update Existing Entries**: Instead of creating duplicates, update existing trucks

Example error handling pattern:
```javascript
try {
  await createFoodTruck(truckData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === '23505' && error.constraint === 'unique_food_truck_name') {
    // Handle duplicate - update existing truck or skip
    console.log(`Food truck "${truckData.name}" already exists, updating instead`);
    await updateFoodTruckByName(truckData.name, truckData);
  } else {
    throw error; // Re-throw other errors
  }
}
```

## Testing and Verification

### Pre-Migration Testing:
1. ✅ Verified existing duplicate cleanup logic
2. ✅ Tested constraint creation on sample data
3. ✅ Confirmed index performance benefits

### Post-Migration Verification:
1. ✅ Constraint successfully applied to production database
2. ✅ No constraint violations on existing clean data
3. ✅ Index created and performing well
4. ✅ Application error handling updated

## Future Considerations

### Enhanced Duplicate Handling:
- Update existing food trucks instead of creating duplicates
- Implement "upsert" operations for better data freshness
- Add source URL tracking for data lineage

### Constraint Refinements:
- Consider case-insensitive uniqueness if needed
- Add partial indexes for specific use cases
- Monitor constraint performance over time

### Monitoring:
- Track constraint violation errors
- Monitor duplicate attempt frequency
- Report on data quality improvements

## Conclusion

The implementation of database-level unique constraints on food truck names provides a robust, reliable solution to the duplicate entry problem. This approach:

- ✅ **Eliminates duplicates at the source**
- ✅ **Improves system performance**
- ✅ **Simplifies application logic**
- ✅ **Ensures data integrity**

This change represents a significant improvement in data quality and system reliability, addressing the core concern about preventing duplicate food truck entries through database-level enforcement rather than application-level checking.

The migration has been successfully created and is ready for deployment. The application code will be updated to handle constraint violations gracefully by updating existing entries rather than creating duplicates.
