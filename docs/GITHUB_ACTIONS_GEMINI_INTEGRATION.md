## Overview

This document explains how the recent Gemini API enhancements affect the GitHub Actions scraping workflow and what changes have been implemented to improve reliability and error handling.

## How the Enhancements Affect GitHub Actions

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic

The GitHub Actions scraper script (`scripts/github-action-scraper.js`) uses the data pipeline which in turn calls the Gemini API through `lib/gemini.js`. The enhancements made to `lib/gemini/geminiApiClient.js` now provide:

#### Automatic Retry Mechanism
- **Rate Limit Handling**: When the Gemini API returns a 429 (rate limit) error, the client automatically retries with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Server Error Recovery**: 500 and 503 errors trigger automatic retries with increasing delays
- **JSON Parsing Resilience**: Invalid JSON responses are retried up to 3 times with response cleaning between attempts

#### Enhanced Error Classification
- **HTTP Error Types**: Proper classification of 429, 500, 503 errors for appropriate handling
- **Parse Error Detection**: Automatic detection of JSON parsing issues
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Clear error types, status codes, and raw response text for debugging

### 2. Improved Response Processing

#### Response Cleaning
The enhanced client automatically cleans common response formatting issues:
- Removal of markdown code blocks (```json, ```)
- Removal of language identifiers (json:, yaml:)
- Fixing single quote escaping issues
- Fixing double quote escaping issues
- Normalizing newlines and tabs

#### Multi-attempt Parsing
- Up to 3 parsing attempts for JSON responses
- Automatic response cleaning between parsing attempts
- Detailed error messages with raw response text for debugging

### 3. Better Monitoring and Logging

#### Enhanced Logging
- Step-by-step logging of retry attempts
- Clear indication of successful recovery after retries
- Detailed error information for failed attempts

#### Graceful Degradation
- Optional API usage tracking that doesn't break core functionality
- Fallback mechanisms when Supabase is not available
- Clear error messages that help identify root causes

## Impact on GitHub Actions Workflow

### Before Enhancements
- **Single Attempt**: Only one API call was made, leading to failures on temporary issues
- **No Retry Logic**: Rate limits and server errors caused immediate job failures
- **Poor Error Handling**: JSON parsing errors created "Unknown Food Truck" entries
- **Limited Debugging**: Minimal error information made troubleshooting difficult

### After Enhancements
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff for temporary issues
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Jitter implementation prevents synchronized retry storms
- **JSON Resilience**: Multi-attempt parsing with response cleaning
- **Detailed Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Optional dependencies don't break core functionality

## Files Updated in GitHub Actions

### 1. `.github/actions/scrape/dist/lib/gemini/geminiApiClient.js`
- **Enhanced API Client**: Full retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Error Classification**: Proper error type detection and handling
- **Response Cleaning**: Automatic cleaning of common formatting issues
- **Multi-attempt Parsing**: Up to 3 parsing attempts with response cleaning

### 2. `.github/actions/scrape/dist/lib/gemini/promptTemplates.js`
- **Enhanced Food Truck Extraction**: Strict JSON formatting instructions
- **Double Quote Enforcement**: Clear guidance on using double quotes
- **Proper Escaping**: Instructions for handling special characters
- **Validation Rules**: Multiple checkpoints to ensure JSON validity
- **Null Handling**: Clear guidance on using null values for missing information

## Testing and Verification

### Local Testing Completed
- ✅ Basic API requests work correctly
- ✅ Retry logic functions properly for both API and parsing errors
- ✅ JSON parsing with cleaning works for valid responses
- ✅ Graceful error handling for invalid JSON with detailed error messages
- ✅ API usage tracking works when Supabase is available

### GitHub Actions Integration
The enhanced client is now deployed to the GitHub Actions environment and will automatically:
- Handle rate limit errors gracefully with retries
- Recover from temporary server issues
- Clean and parse JSON responses more reliably
- Provide detailed error information for monitoring

## Benefits for GitHub Actions Pipeline

### Reliability Improvements
- **Reduced Pipeline Failures**: Retry logic prevents temporary issues from causing job failures
- **Better Error Recovery**: Multi-attempt parsing recovers from formatting issues
- **Consistent Performance**: Jitter implementation prevents API overload

### Debugging Improvements
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear error types, status codes, and raw response text
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Step-by-step logging of retry attempts
- **Response Visibility**: Raw response text included in parsing errors

### Performance Considerations
- **Controlled Retries**: Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the API
- **Jitter Implementation**: Prevents synchronized retry storms
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable retry counts and delays

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor Pipeline Performance**: Track retry rates and error patterns in production
2. **Fine-tune Parameters**: Adjust retry delays based on real-world performance data
3. **Update Documentation**: Document the new error handling behavior

### Future Enhancements
1. **Adaptive Retry Logic**: Adjust retry parameters based on error patterns
2. **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize API usage with retry logic
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement alternative AI providers for critical failures

## Conclusion

The enhanced Gemini API client provides significantly improved reliability and error handling for the GitHub Actions scraping pipeline. The combination of retry logic, response cleaning, and enhanced prompt templates addresses the root causes of JSON parsing errors and rate limiting issues that were causing pipeline failures.

These enhancements ensure that temporary API issues don't cause data loss and provide developers with the detailed information needed to debug and resolve persistent issues. The GitHub Actions workflow now has much better resilience against common API issues while maintaining detailed monitoring capabilities.
