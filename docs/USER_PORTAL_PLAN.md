## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Requirements
- **Provider**: To be determined (Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or other)
- **Social Login**: Google, Facebook integration
- **Guest Access**: Limited functionality without account

### Database Schema Updates Required
```sql
-- Phase 1
user_favorites (‚úì Created)

-- Phase 2  
user_reviews (id, user_id, truck_id, rating, review_text, photos, created_at)
user_preferences (id, user_id, cuisine_preferences, price_preferences, location_preferences)

-- Phase 3
user_follows (id, follower_id, following_id, created_at)
user_checkins (id, user_id, truck_id, location, created_at)
loyalty_cards (id, user_id, truck_id, visits_count, points, created_at)
```

### API Endpoints Required
```
GET /api/user/favorites - Get user's favorite trucks
POST /api/user/favorites - Add truck to favorites  
DELETE /api/user/favorites/:truckId - Remove from favorites

GET /api/user/profile - Get user profile
PUT /api/user/profile - Update user profile
GET /api/user/recommendations - Get personalized recommendations
```

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Mobile-First**: Portal must work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for favorites list, optimistic updates
- **Offline**: Basic functionality should work offline with service workers

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: % of users who create accounts and use favorites
- **Retention**: User return rate and session frequency
- **Conversion**: Users who transition from favorites to actual truck visits
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback and ratings of portal features

## Implementation Priority
1. ‚úÖ Database migration for user_favorites
2. üîÑ Favorite button UI component
3. üîÑ User portal basic layout
4. ‚è≥ Favorites list display
5. ‚è≥ User authentication integration
6. ‚è≥ Settings page
7. ‚è≥ Mobile responsiveness optimization

## Risk Mitigation
- **Authentication Complexity**: Start with simple email/password, add social later
- **Performance**: Implement pagination and caching for large favorites lists
- **Privacy**: Ensure GDPR compliance for user data storage
- **Spam**: Rate limiting and validation for user-generated content
