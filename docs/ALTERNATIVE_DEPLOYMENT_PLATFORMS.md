## Best Practices for Migration

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Use consistent naming conventions
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Configuration Management
```javascript
// Centralized configuration management
const config = {
  supabase: {
    url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    anonKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
    serviceKey: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  },
  app: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'
  }
};

// Validate configuration at startup
function validateConfig() {
  const required = [
    'supabase.url',
    'supabase.anonKey',
    'supabase.serviceKey'
  ];
  
  for (const key of required) {
    const value = getNestedProperty(config, key);
    if (!value) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required configuration: ${key}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Error Handling
```javascript
// Robust error handling for migrations
async function migrateToNewPlatform() {
  try {
    console.log('Starting migration to new platform...');
    
    // Test environment variables
    await testEnvironmentVariables();
    
    // Test database connection
    await testDatabaseConnection();
    
    // Test cron job functionality
    await testCronJobExecution();
    
    console.log('Migration completed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Migration failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Render emerges as the best alternative to GitHub Actions for Node.js applications with scheduled tasks, offering:
- Generous free tier with no time limit
- Native cron job support
- Easy GitHub integration
- Excellent documentation and support
- Simple migration path

The platform provides the reliability and user-friendliness that GitHub Actions has consistently failed to deliver, making it an ideal choice for migrating the food truck finder application's data pipeline.

For immediate implementation, Render offers the quickest path to a stable, working solution with proper cron job support and consistent ESM handling.
