    - **SOTA Best Practices:**
      - **Use Middleware for Route Protection:** Verified. The project uses middleware to protect the `/admin` routes.
      - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Verified. The middleware checks for an 'admin' role.
      - **Secure Session Management:** Verified. The middleware uses `createSupabaseMiddlewareClient` to securely manage sessions.
    - **Potential Pitfalls & Common Errors:**
      - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** This needs to be audited at the page level to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to.
    - **Security Concerns:**
      - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A strong CSP is recommended.
      - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Next.js has some built-in protection, but this should be kept in mind.
- [ ] Test core user flows (search, map, details)
>>>>>>>
    - **SOTA Best Practices:**
      - **Use Middleware for Route Protection:** Verified. The project uses middleware to protect the `/admin` routes.
      - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Verified. The middleware checks for an 'admin' role.
      - **Secure Session Management:** Verified. The middleware uses `createSupabaseMiddlewareClient` to securely manage sessions.
    - **Potential Pitfalls & Common Errors:**
      - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** This needs to be audited at the page level to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to.
    - **Security Concerns:**
      - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A strong CSP is recommended.
      - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Next.js has some built-in protection, but this should be kept in mind.
- [ ] Test core user flows (search, map, details)
  - [ ] Confirm admin dashboard is accessible but needs security
    - **SOTA Best Practices:**
      - **Use Middleware for Route Protection:** Implement Next.js middleware to protect the `/admin` routes. This is the most efficient way to enforce authentication and authorization before rendering any component.
      - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** In the middleware or page component, verify the user's session and check for an 'admin' role. Use the `forbidden()` function or a redirect for unauthorized users.
      - **Secure Session Management:** Store session data in secure, HTTP-only cookies.
      - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **Potential Pitfalls & Common Errors:**
      - **API Key Exposure:** Do not expose your Supabase API keys on the frontend. All database calls should be made from the server-side.
      - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Ensure that users can only access the data that they are authorized to.
      - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Be aware of CSRF vulnerabilities and use Next.js's built-in protection.
      - **Insecure Session Management:** Use secure, HTTP-only cookies with a short expiration time.
      - **Trusting Client-Side Data:** Never trust data from the client. Always re-verify session and permissions on the server.
      - **Exposing Sensitive Data:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to sanitize data and avoid exposing sensitive information to the client.
    - **Possible Fallbacks:**
      - **Page-Level Checks:** If middleware is not feasible, implement auth checks directly within each admin page's Server Component.
    - **Security Concerns:**
      - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A strong CSP is the best defense.
      - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** While Next.js has some built-in protection, be mindful of this vulnerability.
      - **Open Redirects:** Validate all redirect URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Test core user flows (search, map, details)

  - **Verification Checkpoint:**
    - [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` - Verify no new TypeScript errors.
    - [ ] `npx eslint .` - Verify no new linting errors.
    - [ ] `npx jscpd .` - Check for code duplication.
    - [ ] `npm run build` - Ensure the project builds successfully.

>>>>>>>
  - [x] **3.2: Admin Security Gap Identified**
    - **Status:** Complete.
    - **Guidance:** The current RBAC security in `middleware.ts` is more advanced than the simple password protection in the plan. The plan needs to be updated to reflect the existing implementation, and the security needs to be audited.
    - **CCR:** C:1, C:10, R:1
    - **Verification:**
      - [x] `app/middleware.ts` and `lib/middleware/middlewareHelpers.ts` have been reviewed.
      - [x] The existing implementation uses a robust RBAC system with session checking, role-based authorization, and audit logging.
>>>>>>>
  - [x] **3.3: Code Quality Gap Identified**

    - **Verification:**
      - [x] `components/TruckDetailsModal.tsx` has been reviewed.
      - [x] Confirmed the presence of unused variables, explicit `any` types, and unsafe member access.
>>>>>>>
  - [x] **3.4: Plan Discrepancy Identified**
    - **Status:** Complete.
    - **Guidance:** The project contains advanced features, such as Firecrawl/Gemini integrations and data quality monitoring, that are not documented in the plan. The plan needs to be updated to reflect the current reality of the codebase.
    - **CCR:** C:1, C:10, R:1
    - **Verification:**
      - [x] `lib/pipeline/scrapingProcessor.ts` confirms the use of Firecrawl and Gemini.
      - [x] `app/api/cron/quality-check/route.ts` confirms the use of the `DataQualityService`.
>>>>>>>
    - **SOTA Best Practices:**
      - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Use a testing framework like Playwright to write E2E tests that simulate user flows. These tests should cover the entire user journey, from searching for a food truck to viewing its details on the map.
      - **Component Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library to write unit tests for individual components. This helps to ensure that each component is working correctly in isolation.
      - **Authentication and Authorization Testing:** Write tests to ensure that your authentication and authorization flows are working correctly. This includes testing that only authorized users can access certain pages or perform certain actions.
      - **Performance Monitoring:** Use the `useReportWebVitals` hook to monitor the performance of your user flows and identify any bottlenecks.
    - **Potential Pitfalls & Common Errors:**
      - **Flaky Tests:** E2E tests can be flaky if not written carefully. Use reliable selectors (e.g., `data-testid`) and wait for elements to be visible before interacting with them.
      - **Slow Tests:** E2E tests can be slow. Run them in parallel and use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.
      - **Setup and Configuration:** Setting up E2E tests with TypeScript can be challenging. Playwright is generally considered to have a smoother setup experience than Cypress.
      - **Test Maintenance:** As your application grows, your E2E test suite will also grow. It's important to have a good strategy for organizing and maintaining your tests.
      - **Incomplete Coverage:** Ensure that your tests cover all of the critical user flows in your application.
    - **Possible Fallbacks:**
      - **Manual Testing:** If you don't have time to write automated tests, you can test your user flows manually. However, this is not a scalable solution.
      - **Combination of Tests:** Use a combination of E2E, integration, and unit tests to get the best coverage.
    - **Security Concerns:**
      - **Authentication:** Ensure that your authentication flows are secure and that user data is protected.
      - **Authorization:** Ensure that your authorization flows are secure and that users can only access the data and features that they are authorized to.
    - [ ] **Code Quality:** The planned code quality improvements, particularly the type safety issues in `TruckDetailsModal.tsx`, have not been addressed.

## 🚨 **CONTINGENCY PLANNING**

### **Supabase Auth Outage Fallback**
- **Concern:** A Supabase outage could prevent users from logging in.
- **Proposed Solution:** Implement a fallback authentication system using Firebase Auth.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Primary Auth:** Supabase remains the primary authentication provider.
  - **Fallback Auth:** Firebase Auth is used as a fallback.
  - **Custom JWTs:** When a user signs in with Firebase Auth, create a custom JWT that is compatible with Supabase. This JWT should include the user's ID and any other necessary claims (e.g., `role`).
  - **Client-Side Logic:** On the client-side, implement logic to detect if Supabase is unavailable. If it is, redirect the user to a fallback login page that uses Firebase Auth.
  - **Server-Side Logic:** On the server-side, implement logic to verify both Supabase and Firebase JWTs. This will allow you to protect your API routes and server-side rendered pages regardless of which authentication provider is used.
- **Security Risks and Conflicts:**
  - **JWT Security:** It is crucial to ensure that the custom JWTs are signed with a strong secret and that they have a short expiration time.
  - **User Synchronization:** You will need to decide how to handle user synchronization between Supabase and Firebase. For example, if a user signs up with Firebase, will you also create a corresponding user in Supabase?
  - **Complexity:** Implementing a fallback authentication system adds complexity to your application. It's important to weigh the benefits of having a fallback against the added complexity.
