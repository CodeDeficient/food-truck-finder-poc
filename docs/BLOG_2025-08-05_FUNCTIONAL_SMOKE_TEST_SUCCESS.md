### 🔄 Current Project State & Branch Status

#### Active Development Context
We're currently testing on the `main` branch, but the primary focus should be on the **unified user auth login** implementation, which is located on the `data-specialist-2-work` branch.

#### Branch Landscape (Aug 3-5, 2025)
The project has seen significant progress across multiple branches:

**Key Active Branches:**
- `data-specialist-2-work` - **PRIMARY FOCUS**: Unified user auth system
- `feat/restore-finder-layout` - UI layout improvements
- `feature/phase-4-ui-overhaul` - Major UI enhancements
- `feature/pipeline-improvements` - Backend processing improvements
- `fix/map-init-error` - Map initialization fixes

**Recent Main Branch Progress:**
- Build error resolution post-merge
- TruffleHog security scanning integration
- Core functionality stabilization
- GitHub Actions pipeline integration

### 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Switch Focus to Auth Branch**: Move development focus to `data-specialist-2-work` for unified user auth
2. **Branch Consolidation Review**: Assess recent progress across branches (Aug 3-5) and plan integration strategy
3. **Unified Testing**: Run similar functional tests on the auth branch

#### Strategic Priorities
1. **User Authentication System**: Complete the unified auth implementation
2. **Branch Management**: Consolidate scattered progress from multiple development branches
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all branch improvements work together seamlessly

### 📊 Technical Metrics
- **Food Trucks in System**: 85 active trucks
- **Search Performance**: Instant response, no latency issues
