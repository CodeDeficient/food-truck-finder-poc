### Methodology Documents
- **`wbs-task-breakdown.md`** - WBS standards and methodology
  - Status: **ACTIVE REFERENCE** ðŸ“š
  - Location: `.clinerules/wbs-task-breakdown.md`
  - Note: This remains active as it defines standards used in current WBS

## Integration with Current WBS

### Current Active WBS
The main active WBS is `docs/WBS_ROADMAP.md` which has been updated with the revised strategic launch plan focusing on:

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Simplified admin security, CRON job activation, closed beta launch
2. **Phase 2 (Month 2):** User authentication, favorites, UI polish
3. **Phase 3 (Month 3-4):** Public launch with advanced features

### How Archived WBS Items Were Integrated

#### Supabase Issues (from SUPABASE_REMEDIATION_WBS.md)
- **Section 7.0** of main WBS covers Supabase health & optimization
- Most issues from the archived document were completed
- Remaining items integrated into Section 7.2 (unused indexes removal)

#### TypeScript Issues (from WBS_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md)  
- **Section 1.3** of main WBS includes zero-trust verification protocol
- Type-only import issues largely resolved
- Remaining 35 errors tracked in verification checkpoints throughout main WBS

#### Map Issues (from leaflet debug checklists)
- **Section 4.0** UI/UX overhaul includes resolved map improvements
- React-leaflet migration completed successfully
- Map container initialization issues resolved

## Archive Maintenance

### When to Archive WBS Documents
1. **100% Complete:** All tasks marked `[x]` and verified
2. **Superseded:** Replaced by updated approach or methodology  
3. **Integrated:** Key items moved to main WBS, original no longer needed
4. **Context Changed:** Original problem/approach no longer relevant

### Progress Preservation
Each archived document maintains:
- Original completion status (`[x]`, `[ ]`, `[!]`, etc.)
- Progress notes and timestamps
- Links to related issues or pull requests
- Lessons learned and methodology notes

### Reference Links
